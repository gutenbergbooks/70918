<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION<br>

<small>“HURRY! HURRY! TH’ BEEG SHOW IS
STARTING-G-G-G-G!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF course, you’ve been to the circus. You
got there just in time to hear the sideshow
spieler tell you that there was fortay-y-y-y-y-five
minutes for fun an’ amusement beforah th’ beeg
show, th’ beeg show, would begin! Fortay-y-y-y-five
minutes in which to view those stra-a-a-nge
people, to see The Cannibal Twins, the Skeleton
Dude, the Fat Lady who has taken everay-y-y-y
known method of reducing in an attempt to rid
herself of her half a ton of flesh, but who gets
biggah, biggah and fattah, Ladies-s-s an’ Gents,
everay living-g-g breathing-g-g moment of her life!</p>

<p>You’ve given yourself plenty of time, so you
think. You want to see the menagerie and the lions
and tigers and elephants, but the first thing you
know, that sideshow spieler has inveigled you inside
the tent and the next thing you know, somebody
with a fog-horn voice is yelling in your ear:</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry Everaybodi-e-e-e-e-e-e! Th’
Beeg Show is Starting-g-g-g-g!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>Then you have to rush through the menagerie
and get into your seat before you exactly know
what’s happened.</p>

<p>Well, it’s about the same way with the beginning
of a book. You set yourself to have a lot of
fun seeing the main show, and then somebody drags
you off to a side performance and before you realize
it, your time for reading’s up and all you’ve gotten
is a lot of advance information as to what you’re
going to find out if you finish the book.</p>

<p>I suppose I’ve a lot of the boy in me. I hate introductions.
Despise ’em. Yet, in a way, they’re
necessary. I’ve always wanted to write a book
where I could put the introduction at the end, or
something like that. Because, really, an introduction
seems terribly necessary.</p>

<p>But since I couldn’t do that, I waited until I had
finished writing the rest of the book, and then I
wrote this, which I am busily trying to keep from
being an introduction. But it seems that there’s no
way out. I might as well break down and confess—that’s
what it is. Th’ sideshow, th’ side-show-w-w-w-w,
Ladies-s-s-s an’ Gents, th’ sideshow,
while farther on, the main performance band is tuning
up for the grand-d-d entrée!</p>

<p>So, if you’re like me, and detest introductions,
just let this part of the book slide on by and wait until
you’ve finished the rest. Then maybe, some day
when you haven’t anything to do, you can come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
back and see what I’ve been doing all this talking
about. It’s simply this:</p>

<p>I’ve often been asked why a circus carries so many
animals around with it; whether it is merely because
it wants to “fill up space” or because they are cheap
or to take up time before the rest of the performance.
It really is none of these. Questions like
that hurt a circus man’s pride. He really thinks
a lot of his animals, and he’s terribly proud of the
fact that he carries them around the country, because
he knows that from the fact that he does like
animals a great portion of America gains its
knowledge of natural history.</p>

<p>There are comparatively few big zoölogical collections
in America and all these are in the big cities;
especially is this true where jungle animals are exhibited.
The rest of the country must depend on
the circus to make possible a close knowledge of the
various beasts of faraway lands—and there is
hardly a man or woman in America who was reared
in a rural community who did not gain his or her
early studies in this manner. And that pleases the
circus man, because he always wants to feel that he is
something else than merely a purveyor of amusement.
Nor does he do it cheaply!</p>

<p>For instance, the next time the Ringling Brothers
and Barnum and Bailey Circus comes to town, you’ll
find in its menagerie a total of forty-four elephants.
A number of them are babies, purchased at an average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
price of about $2500 apiece, when all costs are
considered. Half of them are full grown, worth
from $5000 to $10,000 each, according to their
performing ability. Lump them all at an average
of $4000 apiece, and you have an investment of
$186,000 in elephants, to say nothing of the food
they eat, and of all animals, elephants are the
champion hay eaters.</p>

<p>That’s one item. The four giraffes are another,
and in case you should desire to purchase a first-class
giraffe some day, just write out a check for
$15,000 and then trust to good fortune to get you
the animal. Giraffes are scarce. So are hippopotami
and rhinoceri and great apes, to say nothing
of pythons, and jungle-bred tigers and lions and
leopards and other animals of their kind. Figuring
the interest on the investment alone, for the
number of performance days which are granted
to the circus, it costs nearly $2000 a week to carry
that menagerie around the country. That is the
amount the original outlay would earn if it were
invested in the ordinary channels of business. Nor
does that include the items of trainers, of food, of
assistants, cage men, dens, horses for transportation,
railroad equipment and repairs, and steam
haulage. So a menagerie really isn’t such a cheap
adjunct, is it? Nor is that all.</p>

<p>A few years ago, John Ringling learned that
there was a wonderful ape in England. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
heard that it was a real gorilla—but didn’t believe
it. He went to England and to the home of the
man and woman who had reared the beast to health
from a disease-ridden little thing which had been
landed in London from a tramp steamer. It was
a real gorilla, the first one that ever had thrived
in captivity. John Ringling wanted that animal
for his circus. It meant that the people of the
United States would be given an opportunity to
study something which neither the combined efforts
of scientists nor the hunting parties of the animal
companies of all the world had been able to give.
He didn’t need the gorilla. The menagerie was
full as it was. But there was the urge of the true
circus man—to bring forth the thing which had not
been seen before, to present something new. It
meant a gamble of thousands of dollars. He took
the chance. The check read for $30,000. John
Daniel, the gorilla, was brought to the United
States—and lived less than a month! Such are
the risks taken by the circus man to keep his
menagerie up to the plane which he desires. This
is not the only instance.</p>

<p>Expeditions have been fostered, men sent away
from the United States for months, even years at
a time, to gain some special animal. Perhaps the
expedition is a success. More often it is a failure.
But the crowds which throng through the marquee
into the menagerie see nothing but the gilded cages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
and the picket line of elephants, giving but little
thought to the effort and expense behind it all.
Which worries the circus man not at all. What
he is after is to get people into that menagerie.</p>

<p>That, in the final analysis, is of course the real
reason behind the menagerie—to help get people
into the circus. But in doing that, a number of
other things are accomplished. In the first place,
the rural population is thereby given its knowledge
of natural history. The farmer’s boy and the boy
of the city not large enough to support a zoo get
their first sight of the lion, the tiger, the elephant
and giraffe and hippopotamus in a circus menagerie.
With that, there comes the inevitable human attribute
of making comparisons—and following that,
study comes easier. It’s much more pleasant to
read in the newspaper about some one you know,
than it is to read about some one wholly abstract.
The same is true of animals. After a person has
seen the tigers in a circus, he wants to know more
of them. That’s when the books come in.</p>

<p>Nor is science neglected by the circus. It was
due to the importation of John Daniel by the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum and Bailey that the
anthropologists of New York were able to dissect
a gorilla brain and carry on their studies through
an actual autopsy upon a specimen of an animal
group which has been almost as mysterious as the
fabled Dodo. The same thing was true with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
giant animal called Casey, which was imported
several years ago from Cape Lopez, Africa, by
way of Australia, by a man named Fox. The animal
was a mystery, and it still is a mystery. It
looked like a chimpanzee, yet had characteristics
and size which marked it as different from any
other chimpanzee which ever had come to this country.
It also had gorilla characteristics, yet it was
not a gorilla. It died on an operating table in
Tampa, Florida, of acute appendicitis, and following
its death an autopsy was performed, showing
surprising indications. For one thing, the speech
centers of the brain displayed remarkable development,
giving the hint that had the animal lived,
there might have come the time when it would have
been able to speak with the articulation of a low
order of humanity. Other developments showed
a close relationship to the human brain—at least a
tendency in that direction. Had the circus which
exhibited it known all that beforehand, it might
have advertised it as the missing link. But the
circus didn’t, which was perhaps just as well.</p>

<p>However, one thing remains—Casey was a mystery,
and to the circus world belongs the credit of
bringing into general knowledge an animal which
hinted, at least, of a strange race of ground apes
which may yet be discovered in Africa, showing a
development different from that of the chimpanzee
and of the gorilla, yet combining both, and aiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
the scientists in their researches into the beginnings
of man. That Casey was a certain type of chimpanzee
was, of course, true. But what type? And
what gave him his peculiar, closely human countenance?
And his great size? He was nearly
twice as large as his friend and companion Biz, an
ordinary chimpanzee, and one saw in them the
dissimilarity that one notices between two widely
different races of men. If Casey could only have
explained!</p>

<p>Some day another Casey may come to America.
And another following that. Circus men will bring
them when they come, and the investigations which
follow may cause many a surprising result.</p>

<p>And by the way, the next time you go to the
circus, just try an experiment and see how much
more real amusement and interest you get out of
looking at the animals. Try a new viewpoint. Just
remember that we are all animals; we all belong
to the same kingdom. With that in mind, experiment
with the idea of looking at those animals not
as just so many mere brutes, but as merely a different
branch of the animal kingdom to which you belong.
Look upon them as foreigners, as visitors to
your land from a different shore, strange but willing
to learn, and with far greater perceptive powers,
perhaps, than we have.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned before, the human race is
egotistical. It likes to believe that it knows everything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
But a close study of animals will reveal
that perhaps they can teach us things, and that,
in their way, they may have every bit as much sense
as we have. A dog, you know, can understand his
master’s slightest whim and mood. But few indeed
are the masters who can understand their
dogs!</p>

EVERYTHING</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>INSIDE THE TRAINING DEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;REMEMBER, rather distinctly, the first time
I ever went into the steel arena. I was to
meet three lions and an equal number of tigers,
all full grown, and unintroduced, so far, to any one
but their original trainer. Naturally, I believed I
knew beforehand just about what would happen.</p>

<p>Outside the arena, on one side, would be three or
four men with long iron rods, the points of which
were heated white hot,—sufficient to halt any beast
in the attack. On the other side would be an
equal number of attendants, equipped with an invention
which I never had seen, but which I knew
all about, a thing called an “electric prod rod,”
coupled up with the electric light wires and capable
of spitting thousands of volts of electricity at the
lion or tiger which might seek to devour me. I,
personally, would have two revolvers, one loaded
with blank cartridges, for use during the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
course of the visit and to cow the beasts into a
knowledge that I was their superior; the other
equipped with steel-jacketed bullets in case of a
real emergency.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of foundation for
my beliefs. Back in childhood days, when I had
been a runaway clown with a small, tatterdemalion
circus, the menagerie had consisted of one lion,
vicious to the extreme and permanently blinded by
blows from a leaden-tipped whip, and three scarred
and scurvy-appearing leopards which hated humans
with enthusiastic passion, and which eventually accomplished
their much desired ambition of killing
the trainer who had beaten them daily for years.
From that menagerie experience I knew that all
animals were beaten unmercifully, that they were
burned and tortured and shot, and that the training
of any jungle animal could be carried out in
only one way—that of breaking the spirit of the
beast and holding it in a constant subjection of
fear. But—</p>

<p>Only one man was in the menagerie house of the
circus winter quarters when I entered—the trainer.
The steel arena stood, already erected, in the center
of the big building, but I looked in vain for the
attendants with the electric prod rods, and the men
with the white-hot irons. As for the trainer himself,
I failed to notice any bulges in his pockets
which might denote revolvers; in fact, he carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
nothing except two cheap, innocent-appearing buggy
whips. One of these he handed me in nonchalant
style, then motioned toward the arena.</p>

<p>“All right,” he ordered, pulling back the steel
door, “get in.”</p>

<p>“Get in?” Everything was all wrong, and I
knew it. “Where are the animal men?”</p>

<p>“Over at the cookhouse, eating dinner. I’ll let
the cats into the chute. Go ahead inside so I can
strap the door.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“I’ll come in after I’ve let the cats through from
the permanent cages. I want you in there first,
though, so they can see you the minute they start
into the chute. Then you won’t surprise ’em, see,
and scare ’em. Just stand still in the center as they
come in. If any of ’em get excited, just say ‘seats!’
in a good, strong voice, and tap ’em with that buggy
whip. By that time I’ll be in there.”</p>

<p>“But where’s my gun? And aren’t we going to
have any of the men around with hot irons or
electric prods—”</p>

<p>“Electric what?” The trainer cocked his head.</p>

<p>“Electric prod rods—you know, that throw
electricity.”</p>

<p>“Cut the comedy,” came briefly; “you’ve been
readin’ them Fred Fearnot stories! Nope,” he
continued, “there ain’t going to be any hot irons or
electric prods, whatever they are, or nothin’. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
you an’ me an’ the cats an’ a couple of buggy
whips!”</p>

<p>Whereupon, somewhat dazed, I allowed myself
to be shunted into the arena. The door was closed
behind me—and strapped. Shorty, the animal
trainer went to the line of permanent cages, shifted
a few doors, then opened the one leading to
the chute. A tiger traveled slowly toward me,
while I juggled myself in my shoes, and wondered
why the buggy whip had suddenly become so slippery
in my clenched hand. While this was happening,
the Bengal looked me over, dismissed me with
a mild hiss, and walked to the pedestal. Then,
almost before I knew it, the den was occupied by
three tigers and three lions, none of which had done
anything more than greet me with a perfunctory
hiss as they entered! Already Shorty was unstrapping
the door, himself to enter the den. Then,
one by one, the animals went through their routine,
roaring and bellowing and clawing at Shorty, but
paying no attention whatever to me!</p>

<p>“Part of the act,” explained the little trainer as
he came beside me for a moment, “trained ’em that
way. Audience likes to see cats act vicious, like
they was going to eat up their trainer. But a lot
of it’s bunk. Just for instance—”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the lion which had fought him
the hardest.</p>

<p>“Meo-w-w-w-w-w-w-w!” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Meo-w-w-w-w-w-w-w!” answered the lion,
somewhat after the fashion of an overgrown
house cat.</p>

<p>Following which, a loose purring issued from
Shorty’s lips, to be echoed by the tigers.</p>

<p>“That’s their pay!” came laconically as the
trainer walked to the chute. Then, “All right,
Kids! Work’s over!”</p>

<p>Whereupon the great cats bounded through the
doors for their permanent cages again, and still
somewhat hazy, I left the steel arena. Everything
had gone wrong! There had been no firing of a
revolver, no lashing of steel-tipped whips; something
radical had happened since the old days when
Pop Jensen had beaten those three leopards about
on the Old Clattertrap Shows. Either that or Pop
Jensen had been an exception!</p>

<p>Since that first introduction, I’ve learned a few
things about animals. A great many of these little
facts have been gained by personal visits, often
in as narrow a space as an eight-foot permanent
cage in which the other occupant was anything from
a leopard to a lion. And I’ve learned incidentally
that Pop Jensen wasn’t an exception. He just belonged
to another day, that is all, and his day is
past. The animal trainer of the present is a different
sort, with a different attitude toward the beasts
under his control, different theories, different methods,
and different ideas. Ask a present-day trainer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
about hot irons and all you’ll gain is a blank look.
He wouldn’t know how to use them, and if he did,
he wouldn’t admit it. He wants to hold his job,
and with present-day circuses; hot irons or anything
like them are barred. All for one very simple
reason besides the humanitarian qualities. Jungle
animals cost about eight times as much to-day as
they did twenty or twenty-five years ago. No circus
owner is going to mar a thousand-dollar bill if
he can help it—and hot irons produce scars.</p>

<p>Which represents the business side of animal
training as it exists to-day. There are two reasons;
one being that the whole fabric of the circus
business had changed in the last score of years from
the low-browed “grifting” owner and his “grifting,”
thieving, fighting personnel to a new generation
of men who have higher ideals and who have
realized that the circus is as much of an institution
as a dry-goods store or the post-office department.</p>

<p>Where the canvasmen and “roughnecks” and
“razorbacks,” the laborers of the circus, once were
forced to sleep beneath the wagons, or at best upon
makeshift bunks, they now have sanitary berths,
car porters, and sheets and pillow cases. Where
they once ate the left-overs of stores; stale bread,
old meat, and “puffed” canned goods, they now
have food that is far better than that served in the
United States Army. Where they formerly were
the victims of hundred per cent. loan sharks, feeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
upon them like so many human leeches; forcing
them to pay double prices for every commodity and
bit of clothing, and practically at the mercy of
brutal bosses, their lot has been bettered until there
is now at least one circus where the lot superintendent
never allows his men to be commanded
without a prefix unknown in a great many business
institutions. He doesn’t swear at them, for instance,
when he orders the tents strengthened
against a possible blow. Instead, it is:</p>

<p>“All right, <i>gentlemen</i>, take up them guy ropes!”</p>

<p>When the weather is foul, and the circus lot is
hip-deep in mud, when men have struggled to their
utmost and can go no longer on their own power,
he doesn’t brace them with bootleg whisky. Instead,
he keeps a man on the pay roll whose job
is to laugh and sing in such times as this—the superintendent
knowing full well that one laugh begets
another, that singing engenders singing, and that
the psychological value of that laughing man is
worth barrels of booze. It has saved the show
more times than one!</p>

<p>Just as conditions have improved with the human
personnel of the circus, so have they progressed
in the menagerie. The circus animal trainer of
to-day is not chosen for his brutality, or his cunning,
or his so-called bravery. He is hired because he has
studied and knows animals—even to talking their
various “languages!” There are few real animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
trainers who cannot gain an answer from their
charges, talking to them as the ordinary person
talks to a dog and receiving as intelligent attention.
It is by this method that cat animals are trained for
the most part, it being about the only way, outside
of catnip, in which they can be rewarded.</p>

<p>In that last word comes the whole explanation of
the theory of present-day animal training, a theory
of rewards. Animal men have learned that the
brute isn’t any different from the human; the surest
way to make him work is to pay him for his trouble.
In the steel arena to-day, the same fundamentals
exist as in any big factory, or business house, or
office. The animals are just so many hired hands.
When they do their work, they get their pay envelope—and
they know it. Beyond this lies, however,
another fundamental principle, by which in
the last score or so of years the whole animal-training
system has been revolutionized. The
present-day trainer doesn’t cow the animal or make
it afraid of him. On the contrary, the first thing
he does is to conquer all fear and make friends with
the beast!</p>

<p>A study of jungle animals has taught him that
they exist through fear; that the elephant fears, and
therefore hates the chimpanzee, the gorilla and
any other member of the big ape tribes that can
attack from above, and therefore, simply through
instinct, will kill any of these beasts at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
opportunity. In like manner does the hyena or
the zebra fear the lion, the tiger fear the elephant,
the leopard fear the python. It has taken little
deduction to find that with this fear, hatred is inevitably
linked, and that if an animal fears a
trainer, it also hates him and will “get” him at the
first opportunity. Therefore, the first thing to
be eliminated is not fear on the part of the trainer,
but on the part of the animal! I am no animal
trainer. Yet, as I say, I’ve occupied some mighty
close quarters with every form of jungle beast.
Nor was it bravery. It was simply because I knew
the great cats wouldn’t be afraid of me, and that,
having nothing to fear, they would simply ignore
me. Which happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of the change in training
tactics lies in the story of a soft-hearted, millionaire
circus owner who is somewhat of a crank
about his animals being well treated. One day,
several years ago, we happened to be together at
a vaudeville theater, in which an old-time trainer
was exhibiting a supposed “trained” monkey band.
The audience seemed to enjoy the affair; but there
were two who didn’t. All for the reason that we
could see the cruelty of it.</p>

<p>The unfortunate monkeys were tied to their
chairs. To their arms were attached invisible
piano wires which ran to a succession of pulleys
above and thence to the wings, where they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
pulled and jerked by an assistant to create the illusion
that the beasts were obeying commands. By
an elaborate network of wires, the monkeys were
made to raise horns, which also were tied to their
hands, and apparently play them. Time after
time, as he watched, the circus owner snorted his
displeasure, and, at last, the act finished, rose from
his chair and sought the stage entrance.</p>

<p>“Swell act you got!” he announced to the owner.
“What do you want for it? You know, I own a
circus; I’d kind of like to have that layout in the
kid show.”</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a series of bickerings,
which ended in the purchase of the act—why, I
could not quite understand. So I asked the reason.
The eccentric little owner waved a hand.</p>

<p>“Going to have it in my show.”</p>

<p>“But with those wires—that’s torture, Boss!”</p>

<p>“Now, nix, Kid! Nix. Wait till I’ve got my
bill of sale.”</p>

<p>Incidentally, when he received that, the new
owner of the monkey band gave to the old-time
trainer a tongue lashing as artistic as anything I
ever heard, a little masterpiece on cruelty, on the
cowardice of the human, and on decency in general.
Following which, he bundled up his newly purchased
monkeys, together with the properties which
went with the act, and took them to winter
quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The next day I went out there with him. The
monkeys were in their chairs, apparently waiting
for something exceedingly important. No wires
were visible. At a signal, an attendant ran forward
with a small table, upon which were heaped
the band instruments which at one time had represented
so much torture to the little prisoners. Instantly
there was chattering and excitement. The
simians leaped from their chairs, scrambled toward
the table, grasped a band instrument apiece
and ran back to their places, each holding the musical
apparatus tight to his lips and producing faint
sounds that bore the resemblance of music! Yet
the cruelty was gone! The wires had vanished!
The monkeys were doing all this of their own accord
and actually taking a delight in it! Like a
pleased boy, the little circus owner walked to one
of the simians and, against the monkey’s squealing
protests, took away his horn.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, with a shrug of his shoulders,
“that’s all you have to do.”</p>

<p>The mouthpiece of the horn had been refashioned
overnight. Extending slightly outward
from the interior was a metal standard bearing
a thin reed; which would sound at the slightest
suction, while just beyond this, at a point which
would necessitate some effort on the part of the
monkey to reach it, was an ordinary piece of old-fashioned,
striped stick candy! When the monkey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
sucked on the candy, the reed sounded. By
such a simple method had cruelty been changed to
pleasure!</p>

<p>The same thing holds true for practically every
other animal act. Instead of making animals pretend
to work because they are afraid, they merely
work for wages now. For years, in the old days,
trainers had kicked and mauled and beaten a slow-thinking,
lunk-headed hippopotamus in an effort to
make him perform. It was impossible. The hip
neither fought nor obeyed. It didn’t have enough
sense to know that it could escape punishment by
doing a few tricks. Then, with the coming of the
newer régime into the circus business, the effort was
discontinued. For years the big river hog merely
wallowed in his trough. Then, one day, an animal
trainer slanted his head and stood for a long time
in thought.</p>

<p>“Believe I’ll work that hip,” he announced.
And a week later, the miracle happened!</p>

<p>“Ladies-s-s-s-s-s and gentlemen-n-n-n” came the
bawling outcry of the official announcer, “I take
great pleasuah in announcing to you a featuah not
on the program, a race between a swift-footed
human being-g-g-g and a real, living, breathing hippopotamus-s-s,
or sweating be-hemoth of Holy
Writ. Wa-a-a-tch them!”</p>

<p>Into the hippodrome track from the menagerie
connection came the trainer, running at a fair gait,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
while striving his best, seemingly, to outpace him,
was a goggle-eyed hippopotamus, trotting as swiftly
as his wobbly avoirdupois would permit. All the
way around they went, the hippopotamus gaining
for an instant, then the trainer taking the lead again,
finally passing once more into the menagerie. The
audience applauded delightedly. It was the first
time it ever had seen a trained hippopotamus.
Nor had it noticed the fact that, about fifty yards
in advance of the racing pair, was a menagerie
attendant, also running. The important thing
about this person was that he carried a bucket of
bran mash, and the hippopotamus knew that it was
for him! He wasn’t racing the trainer, he was
merely following a good meal; the old, old story
of the donkey and the ear of corn!</p>

<p>Likewise the pig which you’ve seen squealing
in the wake of the clown in the circus. The secret?
Simply that His Hoglets has been taken from his
mother at birth and raised on a bottle. His feeding
has been timed so that it comes during circus
hours. The pig follows the clown because he knows
he’s going to get a square meal. At certain places
in the circuit of the big top the clown pauses and
gives him a few nips from the bottle. Then he
goes on again and the pig runs squealing after.
Simple, isn’t it?</p>

<p>In the same manner is the “follow goose” trained.
The person he trails has food, and the goose knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
he’s going to get it. Likewise the pigs which you’ve
seen “shooting the chutes.”</p>

<p>A pig isn’t supposed to have much intelligence.
Perhaps he hasn’t—but you can have a trained-pig
act all your own very easily.</p>

<p>Simply build a pen leading to a set of stairs which
lead in turn to a chute, the chute traveling down
into another closely netted enclosure. In this
enclosure put a bucket of favorite pig food. Then
turn the hogs loose and let then make their own
deductions.</p>

<p>First of all, the pigs will try to reach the food
by going through the netting. That’s impossible.
So at last they turn to the runway, go up the steps,
hesitate a long while, then finally slide down the
chute and get what they’re after. Then—here’s
the strange part of it: after a week or so, remove
the food. The pigs will keep on shooting the chutes
just the same. By some strange form of animal
reasoning, the pleasure of food has become associated
with that exercise of sliding down that incline.
Like a dog that gains a form of stomachic
satisfaction from the sight of food, so do the pigs
derive a certain amount of pleasure from going
where the food ought to be! And they’ll shoot
the chutes for you as often as you please. Particularly
if you feed them directly after it’s done!</p>

<p>In fact, the system of rewards and payment for
work holds true through every form of trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
animal life. Sugar for dogs, carrots for elephants,
fish for seals, stale bread for the polar bears, a bit
of honey or candy for the ordinary species of bear,
pieces of apple or lumps of sugar for horses; every
animal has his reward, for which he’ll work a hundred
times harder than ever he did in the old and
almost obsolete days of fear. Even lions, tigers
and leopards have their likes, but with them the
payment comes in a different fashion.</p>

<p>Jungle cats are primeval in their instincts.
They’re unable to control themselves at the sight
of food, and a few strips of meat distributed in the
training den might lead to a fight. Therefore the
new style of trainer has a different method. He
talks to the cats!</p>

<p>Nor is that so difficult as it sounds. A short
association with animals and one easily can learn
the particular intonation by which they express
pleasure. With the lion, this takes form in a long
drawn-out meow of satisfaction; with the leopard
and the tiger it is evinced by purring, as with
house cats. The trainer simply practices an imitation
of these sounds until he masters them, with
the result that he is almost invariably answered
by the beast when he emits them! The animal
seems to understand that the trainer is seeking
to convey the fact that he is pleased, and the
beast appears pleased also. As to the reward extraordinary,
there is the joy of joys—catnip!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>To a house cat, catnip is a thing of ecstasy. To
a jungle cat it holds as much allurement as morphine
to a dope user, or whisky to a drunkard.
A catnip ball and the world immediately becomes
rosy; the great cats roll in it, toss it about their
cages, purr and arch their backs, all in a perfect
frenzy of delight. Therefore, when they do their
work, they get their catnip. When they don’t
work they’re simply docked their week’s wages;
that’s all.</p>

<p>Old principles, naturally, and perhaps all the
more efficacious for their age. In fact, there is
one circus in the West which regularly depends upon
this age-worn idea of food to save itself in wet
weather. It possesses one of the largest and
strongest elephants existent in the United States,
an animal capable of pulling any of the show’s
wagons from hub-deep mud with but little effort.
There is only one trouble. When Nature made
that elephant, it put concrete where the brains
should be. Training is next to impossible. The
elephant simply doesn’t seem able to assimilate a
command. Which worries the circus not at all.</p>

<p>When bad weather comes, they simply bring out
“Old Bonehead” and hitch him with a rope harness
to whichever wagon happens to be stuck. Then
a workman takes his position slightly in front of
the beast, with a bucketful of carrots, and practices
a little animal Coueism. He holds out a carrot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
The elephant reaches for it but can’t quite achieve
his object. Whereupon he takes a step forward—and
drags the wagon with him. Which forms the
end of that particular vehicle’s troubles. He is
unhitched and taken to the next scene of difficulty.
For every wagon a carrot, and the circus counts it
rather cheap motive power at that!</p>

<p>However, the training of animals does not mean
that they’re simply given food, in return for which,
by some magical process, they realize that they are
to do certain work. Far from it. It is a long,
patient progress, in which the trainer, if he is a
good one, grits his teeth to hold his temper and
smiles many and many a time when he would like
to swear. He has three jobs which must be synchronized
into one objective—to teach the animal
that there is nothing to fear from this strange
human who has suddenly made his entry into the
beast’s life, to plant certain routines into the
beast’s mind, and to place there at the same time
the knowledge that, for doing these things, the
animal is to be rewarded. But there is this consolation:
once a single trick is learned, the whole
avenue is unlocked; and the way to other stunts
made easier. Here and here alone is the whip
used, but for the most part it is only the light,
cheap affair which once adorned that ancient vehicle,
the buggy.</p>

<p>The lessons start in much the same manner in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
which those of a human child begin; the primary
object being to accustom the charges to the fact
that they are going to school. And so the lion
tamer merely takes his position in the center of the
arena and calls for the attendants to release the
animals from their permanent cages.</p>

<p>Often the lesson consists of nothing more than
that. The beasts have become accustomed to mankind
through seeing them every day in the menagerie
and through being fed by them. Therefore
they catalogue them as merely other animals which
are harmless and upon which the beasts themselves
depend for a livelihood. Again is the road to the
brain opened through the path to the stomach!</p>

<p>However, there also are times when the cats
seem to realize that they no longer are protected by
intervening bars, and the old instincts of fright
and self-preservation overcome them. One by
one they attempt to rush their trainer. The answer
is a swift, accurately placed blow of the whip,
usually on the nostrils. In force it corresponds
to a sharp slap on the lips, such as happens to more
than one child, stinging it for the moment and
causing it to recoil. Unless the beast is intractable,
an inbred or a “bad actor,” about two of these
blows are sufficient to teach the animal its first
combined lesson: that a whip hurts, that the man in
the arena commands that whip but, most important
of all, he uses it only as a means of self-protection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
The good trainer only strikes an animal to break up
an attack; he has a specified task, to make the beast
respect the whip, but not to fear it. After the
first few minutes, the trainer can sit down in the
center of the arena and wait in peace. His charges
have ceased attacking and now are merely roaming
the big enclosure, accustoming themselves to
the larger space of their quarters and assuring
themselves that they have nothing to fear. So
ends the first lesson.</p>

<p>After which comes the second and most important
period of all. The animal already has
learned three things, that the trainer will not hurt
him unless the animal tries to hurt the trainer, that
the whip is something that can sting and it is best
to keep away from it, and that there will be a reward
for doing what the trainer desires, and that,
taken all in all, he’s a pretty good sort of a being
after all. Therefore, the trainer selects one beast
at a time and falls into a routine. He cracks his
whip just behind the beast, not striking the animal,
but close enough to make his charge move away
from it. At the same time, he keeps repeating his
rote:</p>

<p>“Seats, Rajah! Seats—seats!”</p>

<p>Which the beast doesn’t understand at all. But
by “crowding,” by the constant repetition of that
command, and by desisting with the whip when the
animal moves in the right direction and cracking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
it to hold him from the wrong course, the trainer
gradually works the cat to its pedestal. Once this
lesson is implanted in the mind of the beast, the
whole door to a trained act is unlocked, for everything
else is accomplished in the same manner.</p>

<p>More than once I have happened into a menagerie
house to find the arena full of cat animals
and a trainer seemingly nowhere about. The animals
were doing as they pleased, some lolling in
the spots of sunlight which came from the high
windows, others playing, still others merely pacing.
It was as though a recess had been called at
school and the teacher had departed. Instead,
however, he was hiding!</p>

<p>Hiding and watching the animals with hawk-like
eagerness, as, left to themselves, they followed
the dictates of their own likes and dislikes. It was
not a recess; on the contrary, it was one of the
most important features of present-day animal
training, that of allowing the animals themselves to
choose their own acts! In other words, the trainer
was playing the part of a hidden observer, watching
his tawny charges, and from his unseen point
of vantage learning their true natures and the
things which they liked best to do.</p>

<p>Some animals are natural climbers and balancers;
others are not. Weeks could be wasted in an
effort to teach a beast to walk a tightrope, for instance,
when the power of balance simply was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
in his brain. So the trainer of to-day, being a believer
in efficiency, allows his animals to volunteer
for the various services of the performing arena.
During the recess time, in which the animals are
left to their own resources, their every mannerism
is catalogued. In their play, for instance, it may
be found that two lions or two tigers will box each
other in mock fighting; two pals of the feline race
that have selected each other as playmates. Naturally,
there is fierce growling and a sprinkling of
flying fur. The trainer notes it all, and when the
show goes on the road, the audience gets a thrill
out of two great cats which leap at each other in
a seeming battle of death. For the trainer has
taken advantage of this play instinct and made it a
part of the show. The audience doesn’t know that
the big beasts are growling and hissing in good
humor, and wouldn’t believe it if the trainer announced
the fact.</p>

<p>Another animal will be found to have a love for
climbing and for balancing himself about the thin
rails of the arena. This is the beast which is
turned into the “tightrope walking tiger” or the
“Leonine Blondin.” Another will be a humorist,
cavorting about in comical fashion, and he becomes
the “only-y-y-y, living-g-g-g, breathing-g-g-g cat
clown in existence.” In fact, the animal trainer
has learned one great truth, that animals have
tempers, likes, dislikes, moods, frailties and mannerisms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
just as a human has them, and that the
easiest way to present a pleasing act is to take advantage
of the natural “histrionic talent” of the
beast. For instance, on one of the big shows was
an “untamable lion.” At the very sight of the
trainer, he would hiss and claw and roar and appear
obsessed with a mad desire to eat that trainer
alive at the first opportunity. His act was a constant
thing of cracking whips, of shouts, of barking
revolver shots, and of scurrying attendants outside
the arena, on the alert every instant for the
leap of death. Old Duke, to tell the truth, seemed
one of the fiercest beasts that ever went into a
steel arena. His every mannerism carried the hint
of death; he hated humans; you could see the
malevolent glare in his eyes, the deadly threat of
naked teeth, the—</p>

<p>By the way, did you ever play with a dog that
mocked fierceness? A dog that growled and
barked and pretended every moment that he was
going to take off an arm or a leg, while you, in
turn, pretended just as hard as that you were fighting
for your very life? Of course, I shouldn’t
reveal circus secrets, but I once spent half an hour
with Old Duke in a cage so small that he slapped
me in the face with his tail every time he turned
round, and I didn’t even have the customary buggy
whip!</p>

<p>The explanation is simply the fact that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
discovered early in Duke’s training days that he
was an animal humorist. Pompous appearing, dignified
in mien, yet possessed with a funny streak,
which the trainer soon recognized and realized,
Old Duke played his rôle so excellently that upon
his death a short time ago, a large newspaper published
an editorial regarding him, and the laugh
that he, the lion, had on the “smart” human beings
who had watched him!</p>

<p>“If Old Duke only had possessed a sleeve,” said
the editorial, “he would have placed many a snicker
in it during his long and useful show days. For
Duke had a mission, that of showing at least a few
persons who really understood him and who knew,
that we who call ourselves humans are only super-egoists,
that because we can talk, and build edifices
and go scurrying about this ant hill we call life, we
think we are the only beings existent who possess a
brain. That was Duke’s mission, to prove, after
all, that we are only wonderful because we think
we are wonderful, that we believe animals are
soulless things because we do not understand them.
No doubt there are many Old Dukes in the animal
kingdom, supposedly our inferiors, that go through
life tickling our egoism, and quietly, to themselves,
giving us the laugh!”</p>

<p>In the old days of animal training, Duke would
have been just a lion doing routine things, because
the trainers of those days didn’t know enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
realize that animals might possess individuality.
But those days are gone. It is a different deal
now; far more acts are suggested by the animals
themselves than by any trainer. The man in circus
demand is the person who knows enough to stand
at one side and watch, then take advantage of what
he has seen.</p>

<p>Which explains perhaps a sight many circus-goers
have noticed—of a herd of young elephants
romping in the mud of a show-lot, and an interested
group of men standing at one side, cataloguing
every move. Mud makes elephants actors.
From a beginning of mud and rain come the balance
artists of the elephant herd, the dancers, the
“hootchie-kootchie” experts, and the comedians.
All for the reason that mud to an elephant is like
catnip to a lion or tiger. It is part of an elephant
herd’s routine of health to send it forth into the
mire and rain of a “wet lot” and let the members
play like so many tremendous puppies. And while
they play, the trainer observes.</p>

<p>No two do the same thing in the same way; the
individuality is as marked as in the members of any
human kindergarten class. The trainer therefore
has simply to pick his “bulls” for the various things
he wants them to do when they have graduated into
performers, one to walk upon his hind legs, another
to dance in the ring as he danced in the happiness
of sticky mud, one more to sit on still another’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
head, and so on throughout the routine. There is
hardly an elephant act that has not been first done
voluntarily at some time in the antics of a play-fest
in the mud.</p>

<p>However, after learning an elephant’s aptitudes
comes the real job, that of making him know that
he is to do these tricks as a part of his livelihood,
and to recognize them by cues. An elephant
doesn’t measure his weight by pounds; he runs to
tons, and to teach him the rudiments of his life-work
under canvass is a matter of everything from
blocks and tackle to lifting-cranes.</p>

<p>Combined with one ultra-essential point: the
elimination of pain. There is no braver beast
than an elephant, and no greater coward; no better
friend and no worse enemy. Injure an elephant
when he is a baby, combine the thought of pain
with the idea of work, and some day it all will come
back in a furious, thundering engine of destruction
that not only wrecks the circus, but signs his own
death warrant. Bad elephants must be killed; and
when that happens a circus checks off anything
from $4000 to $10,000 on the wrong side of the
ledger.</p>

<p>Therefore, the early training of a pachyderm is
a delicate affair. First of all, the student is led
to the “class-room” accompanied by an older and
more experienced “bull.” Then, while the new
applicant for performing honors watches, the older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
elephant is padded about the legs and tied; following
which the blocks and tackles are pulled taut,
causing the beast to lose its balance and fall on its
side, the trainer meanwhile repeating and re-repeating
the “lay-down” command. At the end
of which the performer is allowed to rise and is
given a carrot. Time after time is this done, while
the student watches—especially that part where the
feeding comes in. It all has its purpose—to attempt
to fix in the new performer’s mind the fact
that, in the first place, this schooling won’t hurt,
and secondly that all a “bull” has to do to earn a
nice, fresh carrot is to have a couple of ropes
hooked to his legs and be pulled over on his side.
So quick is the intelligence of some elephants that
instances have been known of the beasts learning
their primary lesson on the first attempt. Others,
hampered by fear, have required a month.</p>

<p>In the same way is every other rudimentary trick
taught. The elephant is shown how to stand on
his head by having his trunk pulled under him and
his hind legs raised. After which he receives
carrots. The reverse system is used for teaching
him “the hind-leg stand”—and again the carrots
appear. After this, the block and tackle is not a
necessity except as a means of support, while
hitherto unused muscles are strengthened. The
animal has learned his alphabet; now it is simply
a matter of putting the letters together, the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
themselves being furnished largely by his own
antics.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this new order of things in the
training field has led to a different relationship between
the man and the beast. There was a time
when animals were only animals, to be taken from
their cages, pushed through their tricks, then
shunted back into their cages and forgotten.
Things are different now. The average menagerie
has become more of an animal hotel, with conveniences.
The superintendent must be a person who
has studied not only the beasts themselves, but
their anatomy, in other words, a jungle
veterinarian.</p>

<p>The boss of the circus menagerie of to-day
doesn’t merely content himself with seeing that his
charges are well fed. By a glance at the coat
of a lion or tiger he can tell whether that beast
has indigestion; ventilation is watched carefully to
dispel the ammonia smell of the cat animals and
thereby prevent headaches on the part of the
beasts; teeth are pulled, ingrown toenails doctored,
operations performed, and every disease from
rickets to pneumonia treated and cured. And the
fact that man at last has learned that beasts possess
temperaments, individuality, emotions and a
good many things that humans brag about has
seemed to place them on a different plane. Where
there once was cruelty there now is often affection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
both on the part of the trainer, and also on that of
the animal!</p>

<p>In the Al G. Barnes Circus, in California, for
instance, is a great, sleek-muscled, four hundred-pound
tiger, that is ever watching, watching, his
eyes constantly on the crowds about his den, seeking
but one person. At the sight of any blond-haired
woman, he rises excitedly, hurries close to
the bars, growling in gruff, yet pleased fashion.
Then, with a second look, he turns and slumps to
the floor again. It is not the person he seeks!</p>

<p>That tiger is a killer. He has murdered four
other cat animals, two lions and two tigers, yet if
the woman he awaits should appear, she could tie
a cord string about his neck and lead him around
the tent in perfect safety.</p>

<p>He is one of the few wrestling tigers in captivity.
Twice a day for two years, in the steel arena,
his claws unguarded, his great jaws unmuzzled,
this four hundred-pound Bengal wrestled in almost
human fashion with Mabel Stark, the woman who
had raised him from cubhood, and whom he loved
with a genuine affection. Once, in a motion
picture, when it was necessary for the “double” of
the heroine to appear as though she were almost
killed by a tiger, Mabel Stark took the job. The
tiger leaped and knocked her down. Then, while
the cameras ground, he seemingly crushed her skull
in his giant jaws. Yet those who watched saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
those jaws were closed so carefully, in spite of
the swiftness of their action, that they barely
dishevelled the trainer’s hair.</p>

<p>There came the time when Mabel Stark was
called away to become one of the featured trainers
for the combined Ringling Brothers-Barnum and
Bailey Circus, the biggest circus of them all.
Mabel Stark is far better known to-day than she
was back in the days with Al G. Barnes. But with
the circus she left behind, that tiger still watches,
still waits and seeks constantly for one woman out
of the crowds which daily throng through the menagerie,
rising with hope, then dropping forlornly
again to the floor, while, in the midst of her greater
fame, Mabel Stark smiles and sighs, and talks of
how wonderful it would be if she could only have
her wrestling tiger!</p>

<p>It’s only one instance of hundreds. Up in
Bridgeport, Connecticut, at the winter quarters of
the Barnum show, lives Captain “Dutch” Ricardo,
“the man of a thousand scars.” There was a time
when they called “Cap” the biggest fool in the
animal business—for “Cap” was one of the pioneers
of the newer methods of animal training.
It was he, for instance, who once walked into the
office of H. H. Tammen, then owner of the Sells-Floto
Circus, and made him a proposition.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said, “that you’ve got a
bunch of bad cats. Been beaten, ain’t they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Yep,” came the answer. “Just about ruined
too. That idiot I had got ’em so flighty they’ll
kill anybody that goes into the arena with ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix ’em up for you,” announced “Cap,”
laconically. “Say the word and I’ll go out there
and start in on ’em.”</p>

<p>The circus owner swallowed quickly then reached
for a liability contract.</p>

<p>“Er—just sign this first,” he announced, and
“Cap” signed, releasing the circus from any possible
damages for his death. Then together they
went to winter quarters, Ricardo to make his first
effort at training, Tammen to see a new trainer get
killed.</p>

<p>“Want any help?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nope—just two kitchen chairs.”</p>

<p>“Kitchen chairs? What for?”</p>

<p>“To train ’em with.”</p>

<p>Whereupon “Cap” got his chairs and a buggy
whip. Then he ordered one lion into the arena,
where he awaited it.</p>

<p>The lion took one look and sprang. Midway in
the air, it struck something, roared in victorious
fashion, then settled to chew it to pieces. But it
wasn’t a man—it was that chair. He disentangled
himself and leaped again, only to tangle himself
with the second chair which “Cap” had tossed in
his path. A third time, while again Ricardo broke
the leap with the first chair which he had retrieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
while the lion was breaking away from the second;
then the cat paused to look his new antagonist over.
So far he hadn’t been hurt at all. Merely foiled.
Here was some one who could outwit him, and who
really had him at his mercy, who didn’t beat him,
but who, instead, talked and purred and meowed
continually in friendly fashion. The lion didn’t
leap again.</p>

<p>One by one the whole group was introduced to
its new trainer. Not once was a gun fired. Not
once was a cat struck, other than a sharp tap with
that buggy whip. That season the “hopeless” act
once more went on the road, and “Cap” Ricardo
worked it!</p>

<p>In fact, “Cap” is a man of individual theories.
Just as his kitchen chair was an idea of his own,
so there are others.</p>

<p>“I’ll stick my head in any lion’s mouth on earth,”
he says. “But,” with a wink, “I got a trick about
it. Always chew tobacco, see? If the lion should
happen to close down, I’d just let that tobacco go
in his mouth. Ever notice how you’ll open your
jaws sudden-like when you’ve got hold o’ something
that tastes bad? Huh? Well, it’d be the same
way with a lion. He’d turn loose and I’d take my
head out.”</p>

<p>Which is an optimistic manner in which to look
at things. The billing of “Cap” as “the man of
a thousand scars” is only a slight exaggeration. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
possesses them by the hundreds, for “Cap” is a
specialist on undoing the misdeeds of others.</p>

<p>“It’s just this here old principle of red-hot coals,
or coals of fire, or whatever you call ’em,” he
explains. “Now, for instance, if you hit a man
that’s tryin’ to be good to you, you’re goin’ to feel
bad about it, ain’t you? Well, a cat, when he’s
clawing you up—he knows what he’s doin’. Don’t
ever get it in your head that he don’t. Particularly
a tiger cat. I always did like tiger cats
better’n I liked lion cats, at that. ’Course, lots of
trainers will tell you different, but I’ve seen ’em
all; I’ve been among the slums and I’ve been among
the aristocrats, and what I claim is, the lions ain’t
the king of beasts. But, be that as it may, a cat
knows what he’s doing. And when he finds out
he’s done a friend dirt, ain’t he goin’ to be sorry
about it and do his best to make up? That’s my
theory, and it works out too.”</p>

<p>Incidentally, one of these little coals of fire took
shape one day while “Cap” was standing on the
ballyhoo stand of a circus sideshow, a lion by his
side. Inadvertently, he poked the lion in an eye,
and the lion in turn bit off the middle finger of
“Cap’s” right hand.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t mean to,” says “Cap”. “Figure
yourself how surprised a guy gets when he bumps
his face into a door in the dark. He never meant
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Which may sound as an unusual example. To
a certain extent it is, for “Cap” and his theories have
an outstanding place in the show world, the surprising
thing about them being the fact that they have
worked out to such an extent that he “breaks” a
great many of the animal acts for the biggest circus
in the world. However, there are other instances
of affection between trainer and animal,
almost as remarkable.</p>

<p>Out on a ranch in Colorado live a man and a
woman who once were featured on the billboards
of every city in the country. He was a menagerie
superintendent, she a trainer of lions, tigers and
elephants. But they troupe no more.</p>

<p>The circus does not represent to them what it
once did. There seems a certain bitterness about
it, a grimness which they are unable to dispel, and
so they remain away. The elephant which they
raised together from a three-year-old “punk” to
one of the really great performers among pachyderms
in America is dead, felled by volley after
volley of steel-jacketed bullets during a rampage
at Salina, Kansas, several years ago, in which he
all but wrecked the menagerie and endangered the
lives of hundreds of persons.</p>

<p>Loneliness on the part of the elephant for his
old trainers is commonly accredited for his “badness.”
But the circus had no other recourse; there
were human lives to guard and only one thing was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
possible, to slay the maddened beast before it, in
turn, became a slayer. But that argument doesn’t
go with his former trainers.</p>

<p>“They surely could have found some way of
holding him quiet until we got there,” is their
plaint, “they just didn’t understand him! If they
had even told him that we were coming, he’d have
quieted down. He just wanted us, and we weren’t
there, and he went out of his head for a while. If
they’d only penned him up in the cars and then
wired us, we’d have come; we’d have gotten there
somehow!”</p>

<p>In answer to which the circus points to pictures
of wrecked wagons, smashed ticket boxes, torn
side walling, and overturned animal dens—in vain.
The trainers can’t accept the argument.</p>

<p>“The circus wouldn’t be the same—without
Snyder,” is their reply, and the big tops go traveling
on without two stellar performers.</p>

<p>A similar incident came in Texas, during the
necessary killing of another elephant on the same
show, which had become maddened through
“<i>must</i>,” and was virtually insane. He had torn
the menagerie almost to shreds, injured one man,
and was holding a whole town at bay. And while
circus men hastened for army rifles, the executive
staff struggled with a woman who strove by every
means of feminine aggressiveness to break from
their grasp, and go to that elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Let me go, you idiots!” she screamed in hysterical
fashion. “I can handle him! I’m not afraid—let
me go! Let me go!”</p>

<p>She had trained the elephant for two years, and
it had obeyed her every command. With any
other pachyderm, she would have understood that
the natural condition of “must” brings insanity,
and that, when in this condition, it recognizes no
one, understands no command, and knows nothing
save the wildest sort of maniacal antagonism toward
everything, animate or inanimate, which may
come into its path. But her faith in this particular
beast had transgressed even beyond good sense.
It was necessary to drag her from the circus
grounds by main force before the first shot could
be fired at the unfortunate beast!</p>

<p>Nor does the love of animals always confine itself
to the trainer. Workmen of the circus are
shadowy beings; few persons know whence they
come, what their life before they drifted into the
nomadic, grim life of the “razorback,” the “canvasman”
or the “big top roughneck.” There are
stories by the scores in the unshaven beings who
sleep about the lot in the afternoons; stories of
men whose finer cast of features tells of a time
when all was not work and long hours, hints of
hidden things in the shadows; they are men who
seldom write a letter or receive one. And they
are lonely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Human companionship often does not appeal to
them. But the friendship of animals is a different
thing. Perhaps it is because they can talk to these
beasts during the long hours of the night, as the
circus train rocks along on its journey from town to
town, knowing that their confidences will not be
revealed. Nevertheless, the fact remains that
more than one workman has been left behind in
an alien burial ground, with no close human friend
to know of his death, and with only a lion or tiger
or elephant to watch for a companion who never
again appears.</p>

<p>More than once also I have seen laborers of the
circus volunteer to “sit up” with a dying orang-outang
or chimpanzee, doing their work by day,
remaining awake at night and nursing the beast
in the hours of darkness; at last, lonely again, tears
in their eyes, to shuffle on out to their hard, grim,
dangerous labors, while a still form remains behind,
to be buried behind the big top, after the
matinée. It was such a case as this that formed
a story which a certain circus owner likes to tell,
as he explains one of the reasons why the workmen
of his show are better treated than they were in
other days, and furnished with more conveniences
and accommodations. For in this case it was the
man and not the animal that suffered tragedy.</p>

<p>No one around the show even remembers his
name. They only know that his loyalty and devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in a strange friendship caused a soft-hearted
circus owner to become far more interested in the
workmen than ever before, almost to the point of
sentimental solicitude. The recipient of that
loyalty, incidentally, was rather grotesque,—Bon,
the baby hippo, or, in circus language, “the blood-sweating
behemoth of Holy Writ.”</p>

<p>Four men carried Bon to the show when he arrived,
a fat aimless-appearing baby river hog from
the Nile Country. The press agents properly exploited
him. Which Bon didn’t seem to relish
whatever, for all that the baby hippopotamus did
was whine. One day the menagerie superintendent
received an inspiration.</p>

<p>“That hip’s lonesome,” he announced to an assistant.
“Round up one of them there ‘roughnecks’
and put him in with it—see if that does
any good.”</p>

<p>The “roughneck,” known only as Mike, was obtained,
and paid a few dollars extra a week for
the discomfort of sleeping in the same cage with a
hippopotamus. A silent, taciturn individual, he
had told nothing of himself when he came on the
show; his name had been plainly a makeshift, and
the circus, with other things to think about, had
made no inquiries.</p>

<p>The baby hippo ceased to whine. Gradually, it
was noticed that the “hippopotamus nurse,” was
taking more and more interest in his charge, pilfering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
bread for him from the cookhouse, or cutting
fresh grass from around the circus lot, when he
should have been resting during matinée hours. A
month passed. The hippo seemed cured.</p>

<p>“Guess you can go back to your bunk now,” said
the menagerie superintendent.</p>

<p>The “hippo nurse” nodded. But the next morning,
the superintendent found him again in the
behemoth’s den.</p>

<p>“Just thought I’d sneak out an’ see how he was
gettin’ along,” came the explanation. “An’ he was
whinin’—so I stuck with him.”</p>

<p>The superintendent winked—to himself. Two
dollars a week extra is a fortune to a circus
roughneck.</p>

<p>“Nix on that stuff,” came finally; “the pay’s
stopped.”</p>

<p>“Yeh. I know it.”</p>

<p>And Mike continued to sleep in the hippopotamus
den—without pay. Another month passed. Two
more after that. The circus rounded into its trip
down the west coast, for its final effort at possible
dollars before the cold weather closed in. Then,
one night, the emergencies suddenly clamped hard.
There had come a shrieking cry from the shrouded
wagons atop the flat cars, the warning of that
feared thing of the circus:</p>

<p>“Fire! F-i-r-e!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Hurrying men “spotted” the cage where a red
glow had shown for an instant, then faded—the
hippopotamus den, evidently set afire by a spark
from the engine. The train stopped. Workmen
and performers rushed forward.</p>

<p>The den was dripping with water, evidently carried
from the circus water-cart just ahead. A
bucket lay beside the cage. But Mike the “hippo
nurse” was not to be found.</p>

<p>Then came a shout. They had discovered him
by the right of way, his neck broken; in the fight
for his grotesque comrade’s life, he evidently had
slipped on the top of the den and fallen from the
train. Death had been instantaneous.</p>

<p>But that last bucket of water had extinguished
the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>TRAMPING IT TO CAGEDOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the romance about a circus isn’t confined
to its sprawled tents, its beauty and rhythm
of performance, its life of the padroom and
dressing tents, its screaming calliope, bringing up
the rear of the parade. Nor does it always concern
its people, romantic as their lives may be. Oftentimes
there is another angle, of which the public
hears little; even the sideshow lecturer doesn’t touch
upon it. That angle concerns the animals.</p>

<p>All because there are often animals with a past
in the circus, which have come to it by far different
means than the customary ones. Beasts that greet
the little seaport towns of the coast countries with
strange yowlings and excitements, which only the
circus people understand. Those animals might
not even recognize a jungle. But they recognize
the sea—often it means the happiest home they ever
knew, a home to which they went as babies, forgetting
the natural habitat where they had come into
the world, and gaining their impressions of life
from the deck of a rolling vessel, with every member
of the crew for a friend and playmate. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
next time, for instance, that you see one of the
great apes, and notice a strange, wistful expression
in his eyes, don’t fancy that he is grieving for
his jungles. Rather, he may be longing for the
fo’c’stle of a tramp steamer wallowing in the great
waves, the phosphorescence of a tropical sea gleaming
at the prow and wake, the sailors sprawled
about and this great ape a seaman also, counting
it all as his home and his happiness.</p>

<p>For the tiger, the lion and the other members of
the cat tribe, for most of the elephants and for
practically all the ruminants or hay eaters which find
their way into the menagerie of a circus, there is an
organized business which provides the channels by
which wild beasts become the tamed, or at least,
the occupants of zoölogical cages. A business in
itself, with branches in various parts of the world,
training quarters, shipping facilities and all the
other necessities for the capture and handling of
anything from a secretary bird to a rhinoceros; this
form of enterprise, conducted principally by Hagenbeck
of Hamburg, forms the principal means of providing
the hundreds upon hundreds of wild animals
which go to make up the zoölogical collections of the
country. But opposed to this is a different form of
entry in which the lines are not laid in such regular
fashion, and by means of which some of the greatest
animal personalities of circusdom have found their
way to America—those off-course wanderers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
sea, the West-coasters or tramp steamers which
rarely touch port in America without making an
addition to this country’s menageries. This portion
of the cargo never appears on the records.
It’s a sideline which has yielded many a story of
animal importation, and without which, in all
probability, some of the most widely known giant
apes that ever have been in captivity still might be
wandering the jungles.</p>

<p>Apes, the chimpanzee, the orang-outang, the
gorilla, look upon bars and cages in the same light
that a human being views them. They mean prison.
It is only when a friendly relationship has been
established, and the beast knows that incarceration is
not a form of punishment, that close captivity is
accepted. Therefore, these beasts cannot be simply
taken from the jungle, slapped into a cage, and
brought to the circus. More, they cannot endure
the cold weather so often attendant upon a landing
upon the eastern coast. The result is that the Pacific
Coast is the natural landing point for these
animals, and their means of entrance in the majority
of cases, the captain or first mate of a tramp
steamer, augmenting his earnings by bringing new
specimens of apedom to captivity. Where the
tramps touch on foreign shores, there the natives
know that a jungle animal, and particularly one that
can be given the run of the ship, is a thing desired.
With the result that rarely does one of these tramps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
start, America bound, without an extra passenger;
which comes to know the ship as home, the sailors
as friends and the sea as a place to love. That
memory lingers.</p>

<p>A number of years ago, I happened to walk into
an unpretentious little “bird store” in Portland,
Oregon. A bell, attached to the door, jingled in
the rear, whence came the noise of a hammer,
pounding against tin. A voice sounded, guttural,
yet kindly.</p>

<p>“See who it is, Bill.”</p>

<p>A cooing, squealing call responded. Then, while
I gaped, there came from behind the partition, walking
sloppily erect, a great, bowlegged, long-armed
orang-outang, which trundled behind the counter,
rested one arm upon it, gazed at me for a moment,
handed me a package of birdseed from a shelf, then
with excited cries and cooing ran behind the partition
again. A moment later, a grinning German,
hammer still in hand, came forth.</p>

<p>“He vould nott be happy unless he answered dot
bell!” he announced.</p>

<p>Which was fine for Bill. But, as the store-owner
confessed laughingly, it was a little hard on the customers,
especially those who didn’t know that Bill
was amiable and harmless. His response to my
entrance had been an extraordinarily tame affair;
he usually jumped to the top of the counter, slapped
his hands excitedly as if in an effort to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
what the customer wanted, then with a wild swoop
descended to the floor again, seized a paper sack,
filled it with sunflower seed and passed it forth.
If the customer became frightened, the old bird
storekeeper was very, very sorry. But Bill must
have his joke!</p>

<p>For Bill, to his old German master, was all but
human. Before his bird store days, the owner
had sailed the seas as the captain of a tramp
freighter, and his ship never had been without a
simian mascot. Then he had taken to land and as a
present, his former first mate, now the Captain, had
brought him, after nine months of wandering about
the ocean, this orang-outang. Bill had been one of
the crew aboard ship. Now he became one of the
proprietors of the bird store, for he was something
more than an orang-outang to the owner of the little
“emporium”—he represented the life that the old
skipper loved, and if the customers didn’t like the
association of the strange, grinning creature, that
was just too bad. The owner liked him and that
was enough.</p>

<p>So there they lived together, Bill and the Old
Man, as he was known. Several years went by.
Then one day, the old first mate came for a visit to
his one time captain.</p>

<p>A scream sounded from the orang-outang. In
the years which he had spent in the bird store Bill
had learned to walk erect, but now, with swift jungle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
leaps, he ran toward the visitor, crawled up
into his arms and clung to him, cooing and chattering.
During the hours of the visit, he would not
be separated, but at last the parting came.</p>

<p>“Stay there,” said the former first mate, “I’ll be
back.”</p>

<p>They never met again. But those who knew the
store told of a big orang-outang who sat for hours
each day, watching the boats of the Columbia
River which flowed behind the store; the whistle of
a vessel, signaling for a bridge upstream would
cause him to leap with excitement and hurry for the
door that he might wait and wait until the ship had
gone downstream. But he did not grieve. Apparently
it was enough to watch the ships which represented
the life whence he had come; he was happy in
merely looking at them, as was the old Captain.
Persons who knew the store told of the twain of
them sitting on the steps together, the old salt’s
arms about the shoulders of the orang-outang, and
both of them looking out toward the river, where
traveled the boats which represented the life which
both once had lived. Then the proprietor died.
The orang-outang went to a circus—and to a cage,
away from his visions of the sea. He died of
grief within three months!</p>

<p>Strange, but the sea seems to have a fascination
for simians—sentimental for the most part; sometimes
otherwise. One of the money-making enterprises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of tramp steamers which ply the West Coast
is the landing of rhesus monkeys from South America,
brought to this country in huge crates containing
sometimes as high as fifty of the small creatures.
It is inevitable that now and then a seaman should
take a fancy to one of the monkeys and, taking him
from the cage, make a ship’s pet of him. Naturally,
it is a gradual affair, the seaman watching
his charge until he has become familiar with his
surroundings, and devoid of fright. This little
diversion, however, in one instance led to tragedy.</p>

<p>The one simian which had gained the run of the
ship evidently believed the same sort of life would
be good for the rest of his comrades. He returned
to the crate where, more by accident than anything
else, he managed to release the latch which held the
crate door. A moment later, the hold was swarming
with monkeys.</p>

<p>This would have been all right, except for the
intervention of another ship’s mascot, a large bull dog,
which happened into the hold about that time,
saw the strange occupants, and began an excited
chase. The monkeys moved for the deck, scampering
across it and at last bringing up, huddled and
excited, upon a life raft. Then one of them glanced
below and saw the sea beneath, rushing past as the
ship moved on its journey.</p>

<p>He chattered and gesticulated. The others
crowded about him, dazed, hypnotized, it seemed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
by the movement of the water. Evidently the same
fascination which attacks a person at the edge of a
high roof had come over these tiny animals. A
moment more and with a weird cry, one of the monkeys
leaped—to his death in the sea. Then another,
and another and another—before the crew
could rescue a single member of the escaped band,
every one of them had yielded to the strange power
of suggestion and had leaped into the ocean, there
to struggle wildly for a moment, then be lost in the
swirling wake.</p>

<p>But the lure of the sea, as a general thing, is of
a different sort. Whether it is the movement of the
ship, the kindliness of the sailors, the association of
human beings and the knowledge of freedom, little
is known, for simians cannot speak our language.
But the certainty remains that for the animal which
has lived on shipboard as a mascot, the memory remains,
pleasantly, appealingly. Several years ago,
a circus was in Seattle, and the menagerie superintendent
was approached by a townsman, offering
for sale five red faced apes, a female with a baby,
and three males, one adult, the other two half
grown. They had been landed a week or so before
by a tramp steamer, bought as a speculation
by the man who now offered them, and who apparently
knew little of animals or their care. The
price was exorbitant and was refused. The owner
persisted that they were unusual specimens, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that, if the superintendent would only look at them,
he would be attracted sufficiently to pay the price.
The superintendent agreed to a visit—then went
back to the circus, grieving that he could not pay the
price. For those apes were being mistreated.</p>

<p>They were incarcerated in an old, dirty barn,
lightless, damp, chilly. The speculator, knowing
nothing of simians, believed it necessary to beat
them at every opportunity, and to this end, made
his entrance to the barn, armed with a broom handle
which he used to drive the unfortunate beasts before
him. The superintendent was soft-hearted. He
went to the owner and begged for the increase in
price necessary—at last to receive it. Then, that
night, he hurried for the shed in which the apes had
suffered, only to be met by the surly announcement
of the speculator that the beasts had slipped past
him when he had gone forth to feed them that evening,
and had escaped. It seemed that the episode
had ended. But there was to be a sequel. Four
weeks later, in San Francisco, a sea captain approached
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Want to buy five red faced apes cheap?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The circus man nodded in assent and asked the
price. The sea captain scratched his head.</p>

<p>“Darned if I know what they’re worth,” he announced.
“Guess I can make it pretty reasonable
though. They didn’t cost me anything. Just came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
down from Seattle with a load of lumber. Two
days out one of my men notified me that there was
a monkey down in the hold. I thought he’d been
drinking too much and went down to see for myself.
Then I decided that I’d been the one that was doing
the drinking. There were five of ’em, scared to
death! Three males and a mother and a baby—.”
“What’s that?” The superintendent stared.
“Let’s take a look at ’em!”</p>

<p>The captain led the way. Down at the ship, the
superintendent found five apes, now tame and apparently
happy in human association. The seaman
waved a hand.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got the slightest idea where they came
from. They must’ve stowed away with the lumber.
Still, they’ve been used to people. Scared of us at
first and huddled together and chattered. But
when they saw that we weren’t going to hurt ’em,
they came round all right and have been regular
pets.”</p>

<p>The superintendent went forward to an examination—and
an identification, by means of a scar on
the right hip of the female. He asked the captain
for his sailing date from Seattle, and found it to
have been early on the morning following the escape
of the five apes from the barn in which they
had been cruelly imprisoned. After that the explanation
was obvious.</p>

<p>The animals had been brought to this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
on a tramp steamer upon which their associations
had been happy ones. Like all simians they had
come to love the sea, and naturally, with their liberation,
they had turned toward the shipping docks
by instinct. In the darkness, they had clambered
aboard the first ship they found, which happened to
be this coastwise freighter. With the result that
the circus recovered its red faced apes, and a sea
captain went back to his freighter announcing
that romance wasn’t dead on the blamed old ocean
after all!</p>

<p>In fact, romance is very much alive, as far as
simians are concerned, for it is due to the tramp
steamer that most of the big apes reach America
alive. There is no more sensitive creature than the
chimpanzee or the orang-outang. Grief, moodiness,
sorrow—these things sap the life of a great
ape as surely as any malignant disease; refusing
food, water, the big simian that is captured and
brought to America by the usual methods of caging,
too often dies before it ever reaches the circus.
But with the tramp steamer, all is different.</p>

<p>In the first place, the West-Coasters travel for
the most part, through warm climates an essential
to the health of the average “big monk.” But
above all things, there is association.</p>

<p>The great apes are usually purchased in their
youth and taken aboard merely as a speculation. An
adult ape is worth more than a young one, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
result that the chimpanzee or the orang-outang
often becomes an occupant of the ship for several
years, becoming the mascot and the friend of every
man aboard. He runs the rigging and climbs the
masts, he loafs about the forecastle and dances in
awkward fashion to the playing of the accordion or
the singing of the songs with which the seamen pass
their idle hours. He is the pest of the galley, the
comedian of the mess room; there have been cases
known where the beasts have been taught simple
tasks, following the sailors about at their duties
and making ludicrous efforts to work also. It is
a happy life for these animals; through their imitative
natures they learn tricks and comicalities.
Above all, they have health and strength, and when
full growth does come, the sea captain knows that
he is going to gain a heavy return on his investment.
With the result that one day, a ship’s mascot goes
ashore, ambling past harbor officials who have seen
him take the same kind of a trip many times before.
But this time he doesn’t return and a circus begins
to advertise an addition to its menagerie.</p>

<p>Nor are the simians all which arrive in this fashion.
The next time you see a particularly expert
boxing kangaroo, inquire into his past. In all
probability that “kang” learned his tricks while a
laughing crew lolled about the deck of a lumbering
freighter for which he formed the mascot and
general humorist, while some particularly burly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
sailor tried his best to outbox him, only to fail.</p>

<p>Outside this, the list of “regulars” which come
to cagedom via the tramp steamer, is small. There
are other importations, it is true—Little Hip,
perhaps the most famous performing baby elephant
that ever came to this country, arrived via trampdom,
the pet of every sailor on the ship. Now
and then members of the cat tribes are brought
in also—but this is not a good cargo. When
there’s an animal aboard, the sailor likes to be one
in which he can exhibit friendliness, and there’s
little of the chummy spirit about the lion, the leopard
and the tiger. Then too, there is the matter
of food; fresh meat in quantities sufficient to feed
a three or four hundred-pound cat animal, does
not abound upon the tramp steamer. But there
are enough exceptions to prove the rule; among
them the case of “Nig,” a queer-shapen, mysterious
appearing black jaguar which is now a feature
with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey
Circus, midnight hued, apparently the most vicious
beast in the whole menagerie, continually “fighting”
his trainer, Mabel Stark, yet subservient to
her with a queer sort of cat-love which amounts
almost to worship. For it all there is a reason.</p>

<p>“Nig,” far in his past, was a ship mascot. In
his cubhood days, when he was no larger than a
house cat, he appeared at a South American port
in the arms of a native who had found him in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
swamp, saw in him a few pieces of silver and
hurried seaward. A tramp steamer lay in port,
a captain bargained grumpily for him and “Nig”
went aboard, to play about the decks, and to look
upon this rolling, tossing ship as home.</p>

<p>The seamen amused themselves with him as one
would fondle a housecat. “Nig” was nothing
more to them than a big black tabby, and the ship
was his to wander at will. But he grew steadily,
to surprising proportions, and there came the time
when the captain, fearful that he might some day
lose his playfulness, began to look about for a
purchaser.</p>

<p>The buyer appeared in the person of a South
American circus owner and “Nig” went forth to
a cage, and to a new life which he did not understand.
All his days he had been free—why should
he be caged now? And because he was caged, he
became fierce; because he was fierce, the unknowing,
unskilled menagerie men of the small circus
regarded him as a thing to be passed by or merely
shunted to one side with a feeding fork; to be
cursed, and reviled as a hateful beast. Then a
scout for the big American circus saw him and purchased
him. They put “Nig” aboard a steamer,
bound for America.</p>

<p>With that, “Nig” went wild. A ship to him
meant freedom, the association of friendly persons,
playmates. He roared and bellowed and tore at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
his shipping den. Night and day his heavy fore-legs
lashed and clawed, his big body pushed and
bounded and leaped; gradually the fastenings of
the wooden shifting den began to weaken. The
crew of the ship became frightened. No one would
go near him to feed him. And as the days passed,
“Nig” worked at his confines like a convict struggling
to escape from prison.</p>

<p>A wireless flashed into New York—for armed
men to go to the docks that they might be ready
to kill him in case he broke loose during the unloading
process. But American circus men are different
from those of other countries. The armed
men went, but with instructions to do everything
possible to save the beast’s life. His future
trainer, Mabel Stark, went also. A roomy cage
was provided. Out from the hold came the shifting
den, weakened in its every fiber, while a loathsome
appearing black thing, his head already
through a gaping aperture, strove at escape.
Down to the docks and a hasty transfer to the big
cage. Then the crooning voice of a woman:</p>

<p>“Hello Nig! There, Nig, old boy! You’re all
right—you’re among friends! Nice old Nig!”</p>

<p>Gradually the beast ceased to roar and bellow
and leap. At last he came to the bars, and the
hand of a woman scratched at his head. The
fierce beast was dangerous no longer. All he had
wanted was kindness and companionship!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>CHARACTER IN THE CAGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time I saw a gang fight, down
in the gas-house district of New York.
The street had been quiet a moment before,
save for two men walking toward each other,
and a group of be-capped, furtive-eyed individuals
lounging in front of a cigar store, intent upon
nothing, apparently, save loafing. Then the first
blow was struck as the two men met!</p>

<p>Immediately that crowd of loafers leaped into
action; soon they were crowded about the fighting
pair; darting and leaping in their attempt to reach
the man whom they strove to overcome. At last
the struggling twain broke for a moment, giving
an opportunity for the gang to reach its victim;
soon the overpowered man lay an unconscious thing
of welts and wounds upon the pavement, while the
gang slunk away into places of hiding lest they
be discovered upon the arrival of the police.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, I saw another gang fight.
This time the scene was not a city street but the
“permanent cages” of a menagerie in the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
quarters of a big circus. The victim was a hyena;
the gang composed of striped Bengal tigers. But
the tactics were just the same!</p>

<p>One began the fight, centering every attention
of his victim upon himself. Then while the howling,
loathsome hyena strove his best to ward off
the attack of a superior foe, the three other Bengal
tigers crept upon him unaware, caught him with
their heavy claws, dragged him through an opening
beneath the sliding door of the cage partition—then
ripped him to pieces! It was the gas-house
district fight all over again!</p>

<p>In fact, when quarrels and bickerings and temper
are concerned, one encounters some strange things
in the menagerie of a big circus—and for it all,
there is only one parallel. For once a person becomes
interested enough to look behind the scenes.
The menagerie ceases to become such; it metamorphoses
into a distinct community. The investigator
finds that everything with which a chief of
police is forced to cope in an ordinary town is work
for the menagerie superintendent also. The same
fights, the same quarrels, the same hatreds are
there; the only difference is that the chief of police
has the advantage. He copes with human beings,
to whom he can talk, and whom he can warn
against future infractions of the law. The law-breakers
under the supervision of the menagerie
superintendent are animals; one can’t punish a lion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
by fining him five bones. He doesn’t know what
is meant by it and simply stores up a new grudge
because he’s been deprived of his food, while the
rest of the menagerie is glutting itself with an
extra portion.</p>

<p>With the result that there is far more lawlessness
in the menagerie than there is in the community.
When Bill Jones comes home to dinner with a headache
there may be a quarrel because of his grouch,
and he may tell his wife that she’s the world’s worst
cook, or make a few other choice and personal remarks,
but as a rule, he doesn’t pick up the ax and
carve his initials in her head with it. But when
some one crosses a lion that’s suffering from headache,
the sky’s the limit. Into action leap his claws
and teeth, and unless there are plenty of prod bars
and feeding forks handy, the result, all too often,
is another family murder. When a jungle beast
is the owner and possessor of a side-splitting headache,
he doesn’t care how soon he kills his mate,
the quicker the better. After which, perhaps, he
can get a bit of uninterrupted rest.</p>

<p>More, in the menagerie, a headache is a perfectly
good alibi. It wouldn’t amount to much for a man
to stand in court and announce that he killed his
wife because his head or tooth ached, or because
he had an ingrowing toenail. But in the menagerie,
the justifications are a bit different. Animal men
realize that the caged charges under their care cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
know what is wrong with them, and what gives
them such a terrific grouch, and so they blame themselves
when these things happen and render a
verdict:</p>

<p>“We, the jury, find that the Lioness Trilby came
to her death because she bothered Duke, who was
suffering from indigestion.”</p>

<p>For, let it be known, all these things happen with
animals. Headaches, indigestion, sore feet, tuberculosis,
pneumonia, rheumatism, toothache, ingrowing
toenails and even insanity are all logical excuses
for assault and battery, even murder, when the culprits
are the caged beasts of a menagerie or zoo.
To say nothing of the hundred and one other and
more natural causes which bring trouble, and which,
by the way, can be found also on the police blotters
of any large city. For, just as greed, hate, avarice,
theft, the desire for power, the difference between
races, viciousness and downright cantankerousness
cause trouble for the police of a community, so do
these things breed excitement in the menagerie.
Behind every quarrel of the cages there is a reason,
such as one finds in the records of the emergency
hospital, or upon the complaint books of the police
and justice courts.</p>

<p>Of all the causes, perhaps the physical ones are
the occasions of the most brawls, those brought
about by indigestion, headache and the sort.
Sounds a bit unusual, doesn’t it, that animals should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
be subject to the same ailments as humans? Yet,
on consideration, it shouldn’t. The mechanical
construction of the body is about the same; why
shouldn’t it be subject to the same ills? Headache,
for instance, or rheumatism.</p>

<p>However, rheumatism with animals comes most
often from a certain thing—inbreeding. When
the father and the mother of the beast are too
closely related, the result is a knotty, stumbling cub,
practically saturated with rheumatism. The further
result is a mean-minded animal, built upon
the same principles as the human incorrigible.
More than one “untamable” beast has been cured
of rheumatism and become perfectly tractable. No
mind in the world can be peaceable with every joint
of the body aching!</p>

<p>The same is true of toothache, and in one instance,
at least, I’ve seen it lead to some surprising
things. Whether you know it or not, the hippopotamus,
contrary to general belief, is one of the most
amiable animals of the whole menagerie. A great
river hog, he has little thought save his tank, his
carrots and hay, and to be let alone. With one of
the big shows is one of these beasts that is so tractable
that he is allowed to wander at will wherever
he cares to do so, and until a few months ago, his
wanderings, especially when the show was in winter
quarters, were made a thing of continual woe by
two baby elephants who persisted in tormenting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
poor old hippo by every sort of trick which came
into their brains. They would slap him with their
trunks, then move swiftly away. They would butt
him about the yard, steal his food, and in general
make life a burden, while the hippopotamus did
nothing save grunt in piteous fashion and strive his
best to get out of their path. Then came the
change.</p>

<p>Bon, as the river hog was called, on a warm day
this spring, waddled as usual into the winter quarters
yard. The two elephants were there to receive
him and to start their usual pranks. But the first
move brought disaster. Wide open went the long-toothed
mouth of the hippo, a bellowing grunt
came from his big throat, and the elephants started
hurriedly in the other direction, while Bon, pig-eyes
gleaming viciously, short legs spraddled, strove his
utmost to overtake them. At last he cornered them
behind a parade wagon under one of the sheds
and there he held them, trumpeting and squealing,
until the animal men came to their assistance. But
even then Bon would not release his victims. Instead
he rushed at the caretakers, and for a time
held the whole menagerie yard at bay, until his
heavy cage could be pushed into position, other
dens placed about him to form a barricade, and
the hulking beast at last forced into his prison.
Even there he continued to bellow and “open up,”
until the circus men believed they had found something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
new, a hippopotamus that had gone “bad.”
However, the superintendent held a different
idea.</p>

<p>“Thought I noticed a hole in one o’ them tushes
when he opened up the last time,” he announced.
“I’ll wait until he quiets down and take a look.”</p>

<p>More, when the time for the investigation came,
it was found that Bon possessed a cavity in one of
his big teeth almost large enough to admit two of
the superintendent’s fingers, and so deep that it was
quite evident that the nerve was exposed. A veterinary
was called and given the biggest dental job
he ever had tackled, that of killing the nerve of a
hippopotamus tooth, extracting that nerve, filling
the root canals and then plugging up the hole.
Nearly three weeks was required for the task, as it
was necessary to kill the nerve by degrees, with the
hippopotamus lashed by a perfect network of chains,
and his big mouth held open with blocks and tackles.
But it was accomplished, and since then, Bon has
been his old, amiable self again.</p>

<p>As to the indigestion and the headaches, sometimes
they go together, and sometimes they don’t.</p>

<p>On the circus, life is a matter of constant travel.
The show is here one day, a hundred miles farther
on the next, while always a day in advance is an
overworked individual called the “twenty-four
man,” whose task it is to provide the circus with
everything it needs, even to the meat which is fed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the carnivorous animals. Naturally, with one town
a metropolis and the next a village, there are various
grades and conditions of meat. One day the
food will be a cold-storage product, the next perfectly
fresh, and perhaps on the third slightly
tainted. The result is indigestion on the part of
the cat animals, a headache, a bad appearance, dull
eyes, and a mammoth grouch. Those are the times
when the trainers look sharper than usual. A lion
with indigestion and a headache doesn’t care much
for consequences. He’s looking for trouble. As
to the specific headache, have you ever noticed that
a menagerie carries a peculiar odor all its own?
That’s what brings the headache: too much
“aroma.”</p>

<p>Every cat animal gives off this particular body-odor,
which is saturated with the fumes of ammonia.
The result is that unless there is plenty of
ventilation, the ammonia so loads the air that the
breathing of it clogs the brain and brings a terrific
headache. I have seen everything, man and brute,
suffering from this cause in menagerie houses
poorly equipped for ventilation, and forced to be
closed tightly because of extremely cold weather.
In the summer, the beasts themselves suffer on
“long runs” where the cages are “boarded up” for
an unusual length of time; there is not sufficient air
circulation to carry away the ammonia smell and
the result is an ear-splitter of a headache. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
often also the cause of some twenty or thirty
encounters that may run all the way from a sharp
spat between two caged animals to an actual murder!
Which explains the fact that on hot days—if
you’ve ever seen a circus on the move—the side
boards often are let down from the cages, and a
virtual menagerie display of cat animals is given
by the show trains as it moves through the small
cities along its route to the next show stand.</p>

<p>As to the other natural causes, the surest way
to bring bad temper to an elephant is to neglect
his feet. The great weight of the beast and the
constant succession of pavements results in “corns”
between the big toes, or great patches of callous on
the ball of the foot, and unless these are carefully
“chiropodized,” there is a bad elephant in the herd.
An elephant weighs from two to three tons. You
can imagine that weight pressing on a “corn!” He
becomes fretful, irritable and dangerous. The
result is that the feet of circus elephants are inspected
regularly, and that every “bull-keeper,”
as the superintendents of the herds are called, is
an expert in elephantine chiropody!</p>

<p>The same, in a measure, is true of the cat animal
keepers, except that their greatest care regarding
the feet of the beast must concern the claws, lest
they turn back into the flesh. A circus with which
I once was connected possessed a big leopard, and
one that was considered the most tractable of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
whole group of performing “pards.” One morning
when the cage was opened, it was to reveal a
hissing, red-jawed brute, his body splotched with
blood, and his mate dead in a corner of the den.
An investigation brought the reason: he had been
maddened by the pain of a claw which had turned
back into his flesh, and which drove like a knife
thrust with his every step! He hadn’t really desired
to kill his mate; he merely had become so
frantic with pain that his senses for the moment
left him, and he murdered while under the influence
of a thing he could not control. So the animal men
chalked it up to mental aberration, and let it go at
that. For even with animals they’ve encountered
insanity in its true form, even hallucinations!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_p064a">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_p064a.jpg" alt="BABY WILD CATS, AND THEY LOOK THEIR PART">

<p class="caption">BABY WILD CATS, AND THEY LOOK THEIR PART.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It came in the being of Buddha, a great, beautifully
striped Bengal tiger on one of the shows a
few years ago. The beast belonged to a performing
group and was trained to refuse to enter its
den at the conclusion of the arena performance
until the trainer, apparently at the end of his resources,
would bring forth his revolver and fire
twice at the recalcitrant brute. Then the tiger
would turn, and with a rush seek its cage, making
a leap of some ten feet at great speed, for the entrance.
However, one afternoon, it misjudged,
leaping slightly to the right, with the result that it
struck its head with crashing force against one of
the steel uprights of the arena. For a second it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
scrambled wildly, then dropped to the ground.
The trainer, seeing that the beast was unconscious,
hurriedly unstrapped the arena gate and allowed
the entrance of assistants, who loaded the stricken
tiger into the cage. Once out of the circus tent,
the trainer worked over the beast until consciousness
returned, then boarded the cage up for the day,
believing that rest and darkness would repair the
damage.</p>

<p>But the next morning the glare of insanity was
in the great cat’s eyes when the side boards were
removed. It hissed. It roared. Then it leaped,
as the trainer sought to approach. In vain the
friend of other days tried to soothe it; all to no
purpose. And the queer thing was that the gaze
of the striped brute was far above the head of the
trainer, and when it leaped, it struck at the steel
bars at the very top of the cage. A hurry call
was sent for the owner-manager, and that wise old
showman stood for a long time in thought. At
last:</p>

<p>“Bring me a piece of canvas,” he ordered, and
an animal man hurried to comply. The owner
placed the fabric on the end of a stick and pushed
it to the very bars of the cage. The beast growled,
hissed, then leaped again. But the claws struck the
steel of the bars and fully two feet above the
offending canvas! The owner grunted.</p>

<p>“Hallucinations!” he announced. “Sees everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
about twice as big as it really is. That’s
why it strikes so high.”</p>

<p>Following which test after test was resorted to,
with the same result and the same verdict. Rest
and darkness, pampering and quiet did not aid,
though the circus man strove for months to return
the tiger to its natural self. At last came the only
remedy for a suffering thing,—a shot from a high-powered
rifle, and the entry of a menagerie loss in
the cause of humanity.</p>

<p>The same sort of action was necessary a few
years ago in another circus when one of a group of
four tigers suddenly developed fits while the show
was on parade. But before Fred Alispaw, the
menagerie superintendent, could perform an act of
mercy, the companion tigers had given an example
of cruelty toward one of their kind. The unusual
actions of the Bengal seemed to madden them;
before the shot could be fired, they had nearly torn
their cage-mate to bits! When the hide of the
beast was examined, it did not show a space larger
than a six-inch square that had not been pierced by
the claws of the other fright-maddened occupants
of the cage.</p>

<p>Fear—fear of man, of unusual happenings, even
of a flag which drops awry and flaps against the
bars of a cage—is the biggest problem that the animal
trainer has to face. The minute an animal
becomes possessed of fear, he becomes possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
also of murder, nor is his best friend, man or
beast, exempt from the effects of the desire to kill
the first thing he sees. Mabel Stark, one of the
widely known animal trainers, bears many a tiger
scar simply because a “towner” horseman insisted
on riding too close to the cage which she occupied
with three tigers during a parade. The animals
became frightened; they fought first among themselves,
then turned almost simultaneously upon
their trainer. When at last she was rescued, she
was a mass of claw and tooth marks—and a hospital
inmate for more than three weeks!</p>

<p>Greed and avarice too are always present. The
exemplification of greed is especially apparent at
a time when one would think it farthest away, at
the time of mating. When the springtime comes
and the birds twitter in the trees, when the young
man walks up the maple-lined street with a box of
candy under his arm, and when the unselfishness of
love is in the air, that is when the cat animal of
the menagerie becomes greedy. The lion or the
tiger doesn’t woo his wife by offering her the best
of the portion of horse-meat that is shoved to him
through the bars. Instead, he eats his supply as
rapidly as he can, then rushes toward his mate,
gives her a good wallop on the side of the head,
and takes her breakfast away from her. Or if the
mate happens to be a bit stronger than he, she does
the robbing. It’s all a matter of strength and determination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and the result usually is a glorious
marital fight.</p>

<p>Incidentally greed, in one or two instances of
menagerie life, has brought strange denouements.
In one case, at least, it made a hero out of a
coward, and reversed the regular rules of menagerie
supremacy.</p>

<p>Although the lion may be the king of beasts in
looks, actions, and honor, he is far from it in fighting
ability. The clash between the lion and the
tiger invariably ends in a victory for the striped
beast, and in several encounters between King
Edward, a big black-maned Nubian, and Dan,
a Royal Bengal tiger, the “king of beasts” had
moved out second best. Evidently Dan realized
the fact, for when the two were in the arena together,
it was a constant succession of bullying on
the part of the tiger, of cuffing matches in which the
striped beast stood on his haunches and slapped
the lion with quick, shifting blows, for all the world
like those of a lightweight boxer, and of rumbling
growls which sent King Edward hurrying to his
pedestal whenever he came in the proximity of his
enemy. But at last there came a reversal.</p>

<p>They were cage-mates, that is, they occupied a
cage together, but not in company, if it thus can
be explained. A two-inch wooden partition divided
them, and while each had half a cage, neither
ever was actually placed with the other. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
several days King Edward had been “off his feed,”
and to tempt his appetite, Lucia Zora, his trainer,
conceived the idea of feeding him a live chicken.
The fowl was thrust between the bars to squawk
and flutter wildly, and at last to be captured in the
big claws of the excited lion, which, like some overgrown
house cat, began to toy with the tid-bit for
a moment before devouring it. But just then, a
new element entered, Dan the Bengal.</p>

<p>The tiger had scented the fowl and noticed the
commotion on the other side of the cage. Frantically
he had begun to work at the partition which
divided him from the lion; finally in some fashion,
he loosened the clamp, and then raised the dividing
board, even as a person would raise a window, and
rushed through toward the tormented King Edward.
But this time the lion did not skulk away.
Instead, the beast turned, a raging engine of destruction,
and the fight that followed was the fiercest
thing that the menagerie had seen in years.
The animal men sought to separate them. It was
useless. King Edward had reached the end of
his submission, and Dan, through his greed, the end
of his life. For the lion, disregarding all the usual
leonine methods of fighting, suddenly adopted the
tiger’s tactics, attacking from a position straight
on his haunches, and with both forepaws working,
instead of the usual one. The result was that soon
the tiger’s claws were tangled in the greasy, heavy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
armor-like mane of the lion—and useless. While
those of King Edward ripped at the foe until Dan
sank to the cage floor, a stricken, gasping, disembowelled
thing. Then—and not until then—King
Edward ceased his attack, disengaged his mane
from the now useless claws of the Bengal, and went
back to his feast!</p>

<p>In fact, the usual end of a quarrel which has its
inception in greed or avarice is death. And those
elements can be typified in queer incidents. An
ostrich possesses three things, the smallest brain of
any bird or animal of its size, the most powerful
kick of anything except a mule, and a positive obsession
for anything that glitters. A few years
ago, a circus made a feature of two ostriches
trained to draw a small cart in parade and in the
entrees, keeping the big birds in a net-wire enclosure
in the menagerie tent as an exhibition. The
owner of the show possessed a large diamond ring,
and it was one of his amusements to raise his hand
over the enclosure and watch the antics of the
weak-billed birds as they strove vainly to pull the
glittering stone from its setting. Then one day a
loose prong allowed the gem to drop within the
enclosure!</p>

<p>A wide-eyed and somewhat excited owner gulped
as he saw two thousand dollars worth of diamond
fall into the straw and the two ostriches rush wildly
for it. Then his eyes grew even wider as one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the birds raised a heavy foot, and with a straight,
outward kick, sent his be-plumed companion reeling
half across the enclosure. However, before the
kicker could reach the diamond, the kickee was back
on the job again, to release a series of blows, and
the fight was on.</p>

<p>It continued for a half an hour, and ended only
when one of the birds, by a swift and well-aimed
blow, caught his adversary just at the junction of
the neck and head, decapitating him. By that time,
all idea of what the fight was about had left the
tiny brain of the victor, and gasping, his wings
raised, he wobbled to a far end of the enclosure
and settled there, while the owner thrust a hand
hurriedly into the straw, rescued his diamond and
rushed for a jeweler.</p>

<p>“Lucky at that,” he mused, as he went out of the
menagerie entrance, “you can buy ostriches for a
hundred dollars apiece!”</p>

<p>So the list runs, even through to that of racial
hatreds. The oft-repeated chase of the dog and
cat, and the enmity which seemingly is never overcome
between them, is repeated in the menagerie,
with the exception of the fact that here it is the
cat which chases the dog. It is almost impossible
to work a leopard group in the same arena or ring
in which a dog act has been worked; the canine
scent arouses them to such an extent that they can
think of nothing else than hunting their hereditary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
enemy. The same is true in a measure with tigers,
and in a lesser degree with lions. In a few instances,
cases have been known where lions and dogs
actually have become friends, but with a tiger or
leopard, never. The sole result of their meeting
is a swift lunge, a crackling impact, a setting of the
feline jaws at the base of the dog’s skull, and the
breaking of its neck, all happening in an instant.
Then the dog is devoured, nor can all the efforts
of animal men or trainers drag the enraged beast
from its prey.</p>

<p>In fact, the only thing that can arouse greater
excitement among felines than a dog is that outcast
of the animal world, the hyena. Here the racial
lines are drawn sharply and distinctly; it is an enmity
which is at high pitch always; the very proximity
of a hyena cage will drive a tiger or leopard
to madness, and if a feline is placed in the compartment
opposite to a hyena, it seldom ceases its
efforts until the day when some careless animal
attendant leaves the partition door unclamped,
when the feline can claw and tear until it raises
the barrier and rushes through to annihilate its foe.</p>

<p>In lesser degree is shown the hatred of a tiger
for a horse, the hatred of a puma for a bear, the
hatred of a chimpanzee for an elephant.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_50" id="i_p072a">

<p class="caption">REPRESENTATIVE CIRCUS DOGS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just as a warning, if you are a father or mother,
and you decide some time to take your baby to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>circus, never allow it to get within “reaching distance”
of a leopard’s cage. Why, no animal man
can explain, but the hatred of a leopard for a baby
amounts almost to a mania, and the beast will fret
itself into a frenzy in its attempts to reach through
the bars, and catch its victim in its poisonous claws,
pull it into the cage, there to kill and devour it!</p>

<p>So the list of emotional causes for menagerie
quarrels is nearly run. But there remain two
things in which the line is rather closely drawn between
the beast and the human. One of them is
the irritation of annoying things and the other is
just general cussedness.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in a crowd—a tremendous,
jostling, packed crowd—where every one is talking
at once, where somebody steps on your toes,
where the air is stifling, and there doesn’t seem
room to breathe? And have you ever been able
to come out of one of those crowds with your
temper actually whole? The same is true of animals;
it is a rule with the circus that when the crowd
reaches unbearable proportions, the side boards
of the animal cages must be put in place and the
brutes allowed to rest in darkness and quiet. The
irritation of constant, thick-packed throngs before
their cages gets on their nerves to such an extent
that there is danger of a general fight throughout
the whole menagerie! More, in several cases
the beasts have been known to vent their rage
upon the crowd itself, and there is the constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
danger that some one will be pushed too close to
the cages. This would mean the instant extension
of a poisonous set of claws, a roar and a slashing
blow which might mean death. So, while the
crowd may protest, the circus knows best, and
closes the cages.</p>

<p>Cussedness? There are just two things to remember.
Never try to make friends with a rhinoceros
or a camel. They are the two crabs of
the animal universe; evil-tempered, selfish, mean
and vengeful. Not even the animal attendant
ever knows when a rhinoceros is going to turn
upon him; there does not seem to be a single element
of the big, armored beast’s nature that admits
of friendliness.</p>

<p>And the camel! He is the supreme grouch of
the menagerie. He’s never in good temper. He’s
the bestial dyspeptic of the universe, and he carries
a weapon in his mouth that is worse than the far-heralded
perfume of the polecat. When a camel
decides that he doesn’t like you, he gives you his
cud, with an aim that would cause the crack-hitting
tobacco chewers of the country store to curl up in
envy. And once you’ve become the owner and
possessor of that cud, splattered over your person,
the best thing to do is to hurry to the nearest store
and buy yourself a new suit of clothing!</p>

<p>But the cud isn’t the only weapon of the camel.
His temper is such that he uses everything available,—teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
head and hoofs! He can kick like a
bay steer, butt like a goat, and bite like a steel vise.
More, once he decides upon a dislike, he doesn’t
stop until he has made use of his every item of
armament. But there’s at least one redeeming
feature; once it’s all out of his system, it’s out!</p>

<p>In the circus, when an animal man discovers that
he is the recipient of dislike on the part of the
camel, he doesn’t attempt to cajole or threaten.
He merely plants a bale of hay upon his back,
covers this with a piece of canvas, then, walking
close to the camel, does or says something to irritate
the beast. The result is a quick thrust of
teeth or hoofs, whereupon the animal man dumps
the “dummy” on the ground and quickly moves to
the nearest hiding place. The camel doesn’t even
notice him; its every vengeful thought is bent upon
that thing on the ground. For fifteen minutes the
“slaughter” continues, in which the beast kicks the
canvas-covered hay, bites it, spits upon it, butts it
and tramples it. After which the animal man can
approach with impunity. To the camel, the old
animal man is dead, killed during a personally conducted
slaughter. This new person he treats as
some one he never had seen before, and all malice
is gone.</p>

<p>In which, perhaps, was the beginning of that old
circus axiom:</p>

<p>“If you can’t beat ’em—jine ’em!”</p>

<small>KIDS OF THE CAGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE circus was in the “cracker neck” district;
out at the front gates, there was
quarreling and bickering, as time after
time the inner ticket takers stretched a hand toward
some scrawny woman with a gangly boy in her
arms and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hey, Leddy! Two bits fer thet kid. An’
Leddy—’tain’t polite no more for gents to let
women carry ’em aroun’.”</p>

<p>This was the district of “stair-steps,” of thin,
narrow-shouldered women, trailed by processions of
children, five and six in a line, thin-cheeked, narrow-necked,
ill nurtured, and ill prepared, through too
fast progeneration, for a chance in life. More
than once the manager personally ushered some
gaunt family through the gates when the frightened
glance of the mother told all too plainly that
there were no funds to take care of the progeny
which she had hoped to slip past the ticket takers.
For us of the circus, there was something pitiable
about it all; the big show likes to take misery only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
for itself. With the result that the owner lost more
than one quarter that day, because of persons admitted
without a charge.</p>

<p>“Don’t need many ladders aroun’ this country,”
said a facetious animal man. “All they have t’ do
is line up the kids and walk on their heads. Ever
see so many stair-steppers?”</p>

<p>“Shorty” Alispaw, menagerie superintendent,
nodded.</p>

<p>“Reminds me,” he said, “I’ve got to be getting
rid of a few of my own. Better be advertising ’em
pretty quick; some carnival outfit may want ’em.”</p>

<p>He jerked a thumb toward a gilded cage in which
romped what appeared to be three rather thin, but
otherwise healthy leonine youngsters. I stepped
closer.</p>

<p>“They look all right. What’s wrong with ’em?”</p>

<p>Shorty glanced again toward the cage, then
looked out toward the crowded menagerie, where
mothers still were herding their numerous broods
along the sawdust pathways.</p>

<p>“Same as them,” came his announcement.
“Stair-steppers. Second litter in a year. Not
much difference between them and the humans.
Bring ’em into the world too fast, and they’ll be
on the bum somehow. Something always showing
up after they get grown. Now you’d say those
were perfectly healthy cubs, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—maybe a little thin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“And weak in the hind quarters, and with poor
hearts, excitable natures; all wrong on the digestion
and a half a dozen other things. Same way
as with human kids that’ve piled into the world too
fast. Always yelping for the doctor.”</p>

<p>Which brought up the subject of menagerie kids
in general, and a good many comparisons. For,
after all, the child of the gilded cage isn’t so much
different from the human baby.</p>

<p>There are the same trials and tribulations, the
same squawks resultant from a bumped head, the
same curiosity and mischievousness, and the same
troublous times in becoming acquainted with the
world and its manners, even to the extent of kindergarten.
More than that, there are the personalities,
the family traits; the children who are bright,
the ones who are dullards; there is family pride, the
don’t-care attitude; the mother who neglects her
children and the father——</p>

<p>But fathers seem to run a bit short on family
affairs in the animal kingdom, with the exception
of one beast, the lion. The King of Beasts is the
original home-lover, believes, according to his nature,
that he has the finest little girl in the world
for a wife, and stays with the children when their
mother has other things to think about. What’s
more, he is willing to protect them. In fact, he
often is too good a protector; sometimes he actually
kills them with kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>It is a menagerie rule that all animal mothers and
their children shall be granted seclusion until the
baby is accustomed to the circus world with its
attendant bawling of ticket sellers, surging of the
crowds, and the general excitement of circus day.
Hence, ten days before the advent of children, the
boards are placed about the cage and the mother
is left in solitude. In this seclusion the babies arrive,
to crawl and whine in darkness until their
eyes open, then to live in the quiet and peace for
a week more, until the nervous fears of the mother
are over and the babies themselves are stronger
and not so easily frightened by the throngs of onlookers
about the cages. But sometimes the menagerie
attendants make mistakes or are ignorant;
the superintendent himself is a busy man. He cannot
look after everything.</p>

<p>Thus it was that on a show with which I once
traveled, Queen brought into the world three fuzzy
little cubs. The menagerie superintendent had
fastened the door tight and given his instructions
that the side boards were not to be removed until
he had given the command. In one half of the
cage was the mother and her babies, while in the
other compartment was Prince, the proud father,
growling gruffly through the bars at his offspring.
Parade time came and the menagerie superintendent
went forth with the elephant herd, always a source
of worry to a circus because of their temperamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
natures and the danger of a stampede. Only a
new man, hired that morning and not conversant
with the details of the care of the cage inmates,
was left in the big tent, and in his work he decided,
like many another new man, and some new brooms,
to be thorough.</p>

<p>Evidently, to his mind, some careless attendant
had forgotten to take the side boards from the
cage which housed Queen, Prince and their babies.
The new man took them down; then, in his efforts
to be thorough, decided to sweep out the cage.
Queen was docile and made no objections to his interference,
although nervous regarding her cubs.
But Prince was plainly hostile; the lion father is
ever ready to battle for his young. The result
was that the new attendant raised the partition
separating Prince from his family, and once the
male had gone through the opening, the man sprang
within to sweep out the cage. This done, he again
raised the partition, and by the use of a feeding
fork, sought to make Prince return to his own
home. The efforts were useless.</p>

<p>The great lion became enraged to a point of
fury. He fought the fork, clawing at it and seeking
to bite the steel. He lunged against the bars,
the great tent echoing with his roars—then suddenly
appeared to consider that the attack was not
against him, but against his offspring.</p>

<p>Queen, in the meanwhile, had picked up two of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the cubs, carried them to a corner and was returning
for the third when Prince saw it. A lunge and
he had grasped the little ball of fur by the scruff
of the neck, and with quick, pacing steps, had begun
to carry it, seeking in his ignorant way for some
place to hide it and keep it safe from harm. Into
his side of the den he went at last and the attendant
dropped the partition. But the great
Nubian still paced; still the cub dangled from his
tremendous jaws. The attendant strove to make
him free the cub by harassing him; it only made
matters worse. Prince offered no resistance; he
only quickened his frightened, maddened pacing,
and still carried the cub. When the parade returned
and the menagerie superintendent entered
the tent, he found the new man facing him with the
announcement that Prince had taken one of his
cubs and would not release it.</p>

<p>There was little time for reprimands. The
superintendent affixed the side boards to the den
as quickly as possible, hoping against hope. It
was in vain. Prince, faithful, protective old
Prince, had killed when he had sought to aid. The
baby was dead, choked through the tightening of
the throat skin as old Prince had carried it aimlessly
to and fro, seeking a spot where it might be
safe! That night, when the circus left town, it
left also a somewhat bewildered man, still hazy
from the volleys of epithets which had flown in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
direction from the menagerie superintendent, and
a little mound of earth out behind the big top,
where slept a lion cub, dead because of a father’s
instinctive desire for its protection.</p>

<p>In fact, in the animal kingdom, the lion is the
model husband and father. It even happens that
the lion father will watch his offspring with more
care and concern than the mother. More than one
menagerie feature has been provided through this
air of proprietorship and pride which the lion shows
in his young. Circus men neglect no opportunities
to provide the unusual, with the result that at the
advent of a litter of cubs, the male sometimes is
allowed to enter the cage where, while the crowd
looks on, he good-naturedly crouches, allows the
cubs to climb on his back, then, growling in good
humor, walks slowly about the cage, the mother
looking on from her corner, for all the world like
a happily wedded pair; sometimes the proud papa
lies down on the floor, letting the kids rest on his
back. In fact, the lion father thinks a great deal
of his children. If any one should happen to doubt
it, just try to take a litter of lion cubs out of a
cage while the father is there. The mother may
seek her corner in fright, but not the father. He
becomes a vengeful demon, ready to fight feeding
forks, revolver fire, anything; even willing to give
his life that his cubs may be protected. There is
only one serious drawback in the happiness of lion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
families. They have too many children—six a
year in groups of three—with the result that all
too often the offspring is weak, prone to every
disease, sometimes dulled in mentality and subject
to sunstrokes. When the circus starts into hot
territory the wise menagerie superintendent begins
looking about for zoos in cool climates that desire
cat animals, especially lions. Otherwise the penalties
of birth may cause a few losses to be entered
in the ledgers of the treasury wagon.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite in family bliss is the estate
of the tiger. With Mr. and Mrs. Bengal there
isn’t any such thing. The female tiger hates her
mate and he dislikes her as cordially. Not only
that, but he doesn’t seem to understand why there
should be children in any family. To a gentleman
tiger, there is no greater indoor sport than that of
murdering his offspring, while to the mother there
is nothing that merits greater love and protection
than the one or two cubs which arrive every few
years, for the tiger has children but seldom in
captivity. Never is there offspring more than once
a year, and sometimes the space lengthens to only
once in three years; and usually there is but one
cub.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there’s a sex problem in tigerdom;
many a tigress goes through life an old maid, simply
because there are not enough gentlemen tigers to
go round. An invariable rule seems to hold sway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
with the striped beasts; if only one cub is born, the
menagerie superintendent may announce a boy or
a girl, for with the single child the matter of sex
seems to be a haphazard affair. But let two cubs
come into the world and one of them will be a male
while the other invariably will be a female; while
with the advent of a litter of three, there is usually
a ratio of two females to one male, with the result
that there is always a preponderance of female
tigers. Perhaps that’s what makes the males so
grouchy.</p>

<p>For grouchy they are, especially toward their
children. If the father enters, through some accident,
the mother’s side of the cage, it always
means a skirmish, and a wild effort on the part of
the female to protect her young, usually resulting
in failure. The male tiger is much larger and
stronger, with the result that a brief battle leaves
her gasping and terrified, while with quick pounces
and snarls of seeming delight, the father murders
his children, one by one, and then devours them!
But once, at least, in the circus world, there was
reversal of the usual happening.</p>

<p>Grace and Calcutta were the parents of three
children, and loved each other as soap loves a buzz
saw. Partitioned from each other in the same
cage, they spent most of their time in snarling and
hissing at each other, the big male bounding and
leaping at the bars, striving in his utmost to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
through. Then, one day, a careless attendant
left the partition open, and Calcutta gained his
object.</p>

<p>But his rush did not seem to frighten Grace.
Her cubs behind her, she swayed uncertainly for a
moment, as if summoning every atom of her
strength. Then, before attendants could separate
them, they had met!</p>

<p>The fight which followed is history in the circus,
passed along from one menagerie superintendent to
another as an example of mother love and desperation.
Grace was fully fifty pounds lighter than her
vengeful mate, but the thought of weight, or power
or strength did not seem to enter her mind. She
only knew that if once the great, striped thing
passed her, three cubs would die, and she fought
for them with every vestige of her strength.
In vain the menagerie men strove to separate the
struggling pair. The hose cart was hurried within
the tent, and, the pump working to its utmost, the
full force of water was turned upon them, the one
thing which can be counted upon to cause a caged
animal to desist from an attack. Neither Grace
nor Calcutta seemed even to notice it. At last,
the side boards were raised, in the hope that darkness
might end the battle. It only increased the
turmoil within, the noise of which rose higher and
higher, at last to cease. The battle was over.</p>

<p>Hurriedly the men dropped the side boards—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
a futile hope. Calcutta was dead, stretched almost
the length of the compartment, while huddled in
a corner lay Grace, bleeding from a hundred tooth
and claw marks, but apparently content to lick and
growl at the three frightened cubs which tumbled
about her!</p>

<p>Nor is it the father which is always the murderer
in the tiger family. Sometimes it is the mother
herself, following in beast life the theory of Wilde’s
“Ballad of Reading Gaol” by killing the thing
which she loves best!</p>

<p>Of all the caged beasts of the circus, the tiger
is the most nervous and high-strung. Permanent
insanity among tigers is not at all unusual, while
insanity for the mother at the time of the birth
of her young is a thing which every menagerie man
fears. During this insanity, the tiger is the enemy
of everything, including herself. She kills her cubs,
she tears at her own flesh, she howls and roars and
thunders until the menagerie is a pandemonium.
And the next day, once more possessed of her
mental balance, she wanders about her cage, whining
pitifully, searching, searching for the thing that
is gone, her baby, murdered while she had no
knowledge of her actions. Nor can anything appease
her—month after month she will search, until
at last, like a human mother, her grief assuages
itself in the expectation of a new brood.</p>

<p>From all of which may be gained the idea that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
a tiger baby hasn’t an easy time in life. To tell
the truth, next to the leopard, its lot is about the
hardest in the menagerie. Threatened by both
father and mother at birth, with nervous stomachs
and belligerent dispositions, the tiger cub fights almost
a constant battle for life. Of all the cat
animals, a tiger that has passed the danger mark,
when it can shift for itself, is the most celebrated
thing in the show. And again it is the female
which usually wins the tussle. The male tiger is
born with blood in his eye. He is not allowed to
play about the circus, the pet of every canvasman
and roughneck and animal man and performer,
as is the lion cub, which in its childhood is little
different from a house cat. Instead, the tiger baby
must be kept caged. Otherwise it will tackle the
first dog that comes along, regardless of the disadvantage
in size, and there will be another feline
catastrophe to mourn.</p>

<p>As for the leopard, it is the slum child of the
animal kingdom. Its mother cares nothing about
it, the father is a brute, and almost from the moment
that the baby’s eyes are open, it shifts for
itself. But what it loses in parental affection, it
makes up in play; there is nothing in the whole
menagerie which plays harder, not even the
monkey. The bars of the cage were made for
climbing, and up the leopard kittens go, nor seem
to care when they fall from the top of the den,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
landing on their heads with enough force almost to
knock them unconscious. To which the female
pays little or no attention.</p>

<p>The result is that the leopard kitten, like the
human street urchin, develops an amazing courage
and cunning; it is afraid of nothing, brooks no
obstacle in its play and, through the bars, will even
hiss and snarl at a full-grown lion and give every
evidence of a desire to break through and attack
it! Meanwhile the mother snores on in her corner,
or merely looks up for a moment in half-curious
fashion, then goes ahead with her sleep. Babies
don’t bother her!</p>

<p>In fact, a great deal of interference on the part
of animal attendants enters into the rearings of
a healthy baby, especially in the cat tribe. Especially
is this true in the matter of diseases, for the
life of about one out of every four children that
come to healthy maturity is due, not to the mothers,
but to the menagerie superintendent and his assistants.
Around a circus it is nothing to see a
lion cub being rubbed with warm oil, or squawking
his displeasure at a mustard draught, or even
swaddled in flannel bandages to combat a “cold”
which, if allowed to progress, may become pneumonia
overnight and result in death. During the
epidemics of influenza, those persons with the
strongest lungs often were the surest victims, once
the disease became seated. So it is with the lion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
That beast has the strongest lungs of any animal,
and it is the most prone to death, once pneumonia
strikes it.</p>

<p>You’ve seen the constant human “sniffler”, always
possessing a cold yet never even bothered
about it. The baby tiger is its counterpart.
More delicate generally, with lungs much weaker,
constitutions built upon a less stockier plan, yet
pneumonia is rare. Instead, the tiger child prefers
to have chills and fever, corresponding to the ague
in the human, and shaking through the hours of
even a hot afternoon. Incidentally it becomes the
recipient of a hated remedy, equally disgusting to
the lion, the tiger, the llama, the leopard or the
elephant—for they all are dosed with it, as to the
human child. Its name is castor oil!</p>

<p>Reverting, however, to leopard babies, theirs
is the hardest lot of any in the menagerie. There
is no cure for their ailment, which begins to come
upon them about the time they are half-grown;
every one, it seems, is destined to become a victim;
sooner or later a menagerie attendant will motion
with his head and announce:</p>

<p>“Sure had a tough time with that Lucy leopard.
Begun throwin’ ’em this mornin’. Thought she
was gone for a half-hour or so.”</p>

<p>The disease is epilepsy and few indeed are the
leopards which go through life without it. In the
midst of play, or in the middle of an act—it chooses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
no time—there come frightened clawings, terrific
convulsions and stiffenings which seem to threaten
the breaking of the spine, and the torture is on.
Nor have all the efforts of veterinaries or doctors
or highly schooled menagerie men been able to combat
it.</p>

<p>That epilepsy, by the way, has led to some
strange results in the circus, and some exciting moments.
A few years ago, on a show with which I
was connected, we very proudly announced a performing
father and son, Old Man and his youngster,
just maturing, Dick. They worked well together,
looked a great deal alike, and obeyed every command
implicitly. Neither of them had ever shown
any evidences of epilepsy, and around the circus
we hoped that here would be one case where it
did not occur.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t. The afternoon was hot, the big
top crowded. Out came Old Man and Dick into
the steel arena to go through their stunts. But
as the trainer gave the command to Old Man,
there arrived the first hint of trouble. The big
leopard merely remained on his pedestal, staring
and “wall-eyed.” The next moment, while the
great audience stiffened with fright, there came a
screeching yowl, and Old Man went about eight
feet in the air with the beginning of an epileptic fit.
From every corner of the tent came the announcers,
to bawl the news that the beast was only having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
fit and that there was no danger. In the meantime,
Dick, the son, looked on with excited interest, at
last to hop from his pedestal, trot over to his
father, look at him, cock his head—and throw a
fit himself!</p>

<p>There they were, a trainer and two leopards, the
beasts doing everything from turning airsets to back-bends,
contortionist poses and flip-flops, the audience
yelling for something to be done, and nothing
of the kind possible. It was one of those
moments when circus men wished they’d never gone
into the business; but they could do nothing. The
beasts could not be approached; the only thing possible
was to wait for them to “come out of it.”
This Dick did in a few moments, looked around
him with a startled meow, then wabbled weakly toward
the open door of the shifting den. But Old
Man remained stretched out, his heart apparently
stopped, his appearance giving every evidence of
death. Hurriedly two roughnecks came forward
and bundled him into a piece of canvas, carried him
outside the big top, and covered him there, while
within was fevered activity that the big arena might
be pulled down, and acts hurried into the rings and
hippodrome track to cause as much forgetfulness
as possible of the unpleasant occurrences. But the
excitement had just begun!</p>

<p>The band was playing, the clowns cavorting, and
everything moving swiftly and pleasantly once more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
only to be interrupted, by a goggle-eyed townsman,
who burst under the side wall, leaped across the
hippodrome track and tried his best to climb a
center-pole as he yelped the announcement:</p>

<p>“Gosh! There’s a leopard loose out there!”</p>

<p>Old Man wasn’t dead at all. Instead, he had
regained consciousness, rolled out of his canvas
shroud and now was busily trying to kill a dog.
Once more the announcers, ushers and every possible
recruit from the dressing tent were called to
assure the audience that there was no danger
while outside the hose cart was brought forward
and the stream turned on the combatants to separate
them. Finally they succeeded, while Old
Man was entangled in a tarpaulin, rolled up in its
heavy folds and returned to his cage. He never
worked again.</p>

<p>Nor did Dick, his son. The next day both were
the victims of another fit, and at intervals of once
or twice a week following. At last Old Man lay
still again, and this time death had come in earnest.
Dick followed him three days later, in spite of
everything that menagerie men and hastily summoned
veterinaries could do. Epilepsy among leopards
brooks no obstacle. Its object is death, and
it attains always that which it seeks.</p>

<p>Nor is epilepsy the only thing against which animal
men have to contend. There’s colic, for instance,
stomach troubles, “bone-head” animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
which simply can’t seem to grasp the scheme of
things, “star gazers,” or inbred lions afflicted with
a curvature of the spine which makes them stare
constantly upward, tigers which eat and eat and
eat, the only result being that all the nourishment
seems to go to their tails, actually weighing them
down and sapping their strength until at last an
operation is necessary. There have been instances
in circusdom where a full eight inches of tail has
been amputated before a beast could get any bodily
results from his feeding. All in all, the menagerie
man has just about as much to contend with in his
charges as the head nurse of any big children’s
institution. Perhaps more. For in addition to his
regular clinic of babies which show up with this,
that or the other detriment, he usually is the
“mother” of a varied assortment of orphans.</p>

<p>Like many a human orphan, the adult result has
become extremely valuable in its little world. One,
for instance, was Sultan, now a prized performer
which, through the illness of its mother at the time
of its birth, was neglected by her until human
interference was necessary. The person who interfered
was Lucia Zora, famous elephant and animal
trainer, and wife of the menagerie superintendent.
For three months Zora carried her
adopted “child” to and from the circus lot in a
covered lunch basket, while the yowling youngster
demanded his bottle—a regulation baby’s nursing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
bottle—every two hours, the milk being prepared
in the same manner as for a real child.</p>

<p>Nor did night bring any surcease from the care
of the infant lion. Midnight always brought hunger
and squalling which awakened the whole Pull-man
where Sultan was supposed to sleep under
Zora’s berth, but where it did everything from
chewing up curtains to running off with the shoes of
the actors. At five o’clock in the morning came the
same performance, with the result that Zora spent
a good part of the time when she should have been
resting in hauling forth dishes, an alcohol stove and
the inevitable bottle for the feeding of the orphan.
For four months the baby clung to the bottle before
he would lap milk. Following which the lion
proved to be a little experiment in environment.
Also an evidence that jungle animals are no different
from the human race. The cave man ate only
meat; he knew nothing else. The same with jungle
beasts. During the struggle of the Ringling-Barnum
Circus to save the life of John Daniel, a
few years ago, the only thing which sustained the
big ape was beef broth. Yet gorillas are vegetarians.
With Sultan, scion of meat-eating family,
there came the time during his two years of petting
when he relished asparagus, bread and butter, buttered
beets, and had a particular liking for strawberries
and cream.</p>

<p>During the winter months of those two years he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
lived in Zora’s home—or rather, did his best to
wreck it, madly swinging on the bottom of the lace
curtains, and once climbing the table cloth and pulling
it to the floor, just at the moment when it was
covered with food for four guests. All of which
Zora forgave. But when Sultan sallied forth one
day, killed three pet Belgian hares, two prized White
Orpingtons, and chased a neighbor’s cat through that
neighbor’s house, knocking over chairs, pulling down
curtains, sweeping clean the shelves of a pantry and
causing a riot call to police headquarters, Zora
decided that perhaps the best place for a lusty
young lion was in a cage in the menagerie house.</p>

<p>Another famous lion, said by a great many to
be the greatest performing lion in the world, was
also a bottle baby, raised by about the same methods
by Mrs. Walter Beckwith, and a member of the
Beckwith troupe of lions which do a great deal of
work in the motion-picture studios. There is one
difference, however, and that was the fact that he
never was allowed to grow hungry, nor was any one
ever allowed to go near him at feeding time, which
invariably took place within his cage. The result
was that food came to represent to him something
which need not be sought, and which could be found
only within a cage; hence the animal has no thought
of it when he is working outside his den and can be
trusted implicitly.</p>

<p>However, for two animals, there is no such thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
as surcease from orphanage, the tiger and the leopard.
Both are too frail, too prone to inherited
weaknesses, to survive on artificial feeding. But all
this is overcome by the child hippopotamus, who,
once taken from the side of his hefty mother,
demands a nurse, and in no uncertain terms. The
baby hippo, the whole half-ton of him, wants a
human companion, and if he doesn’t get one, right
then he lays himself down and literally bawls himself
to death. He won’t eat, he won’t sleep, he
won’t play in the waters of his tank; he just wants
a playmate. Incidentally, this yearning for companionship
once caused one of the strangest sights
in the circus world.</p>

<p>Bon was the baby, a bulbous thing of some five
hundred pounds when he arrived from the old home
place on the River Nile. The result was that Bon
began to grieve to such an extent that he worked
himself into a state of hysteria, if such a thing can
be imagined in a member of the hog family, to
which the hippo belongs. Then one day the crisis
arrived; Bon began to beat his head against the
bars, a favorite method which grieving hippopotami
seem to have for committing suicide. That
night Bon was happy. He had a human companion,
known by no other name than Mike—and the world
was good again.</p>

<p>The story of Mike and Bon has been told in a
previous chapter, for it is a little instance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
love of a man for a fool beast, and a love that was
returned. Enough that Mike gave his life to save
that of the hippopotamus. But there is one incident
that has not been told, the story of his burial.</p>

<p>The circus bought a lot for Mike in one of the
best cemeteries of the Western town near which his
death occurred. The usual “round robin” went
about the circus lot for flowers. There was only
one time in which the show people could pay their
last respects to the faithful Mike, and that came
between parade and show time. That morning,
the few people in the big cemetery saw a strange
cavalcade turn through the gates of the burial place,
winding among the silent tombstones and mausoleums.
The band men atop the carved wagons
playing music strange to the circus; the lions shifting
in their cages; the equestriennes, with their white,
be-ribboned horses, riding beside the hearse; the
snares and bases of the Zouave drum corps muffled
and beating in slow time to the funeral music from
the big-top and kid-show bands; the clowns slumped
on the big tableaux—the whole circus, Mike’s
beloved circus, with its colors, its beautiful, mottled
parade horses, its cages, its clowns and couriers and
Wild West riders, with Bon whining in his big tank
in dumb wonderment as to what had become of his
companion—Mike’s circus had come to say good-by.
And some way, to those who watched, there
was nothing strange about it, nothing incongruous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
They were of his life—a grim, rushing, tumultuous
life behind its covering gaudiness, and neither the
paint, nor the spangles, nor glittering colors seemed
to matter.</p>

<p>I’ve often wondered what the conversation would
be if a bunch of menagerie mothers could get together
and talk over the various traits of their children,
as humans do. There should be some very
good conversation, for each baby, it seems, has his
own particular temperament and characteristics.</p>

<p>For instance, the matter of play. Even a baby
hippopotamus will play, somewhat after the fashion
of a lopsided barrel. An elephant baby is as mischievous
as a young puppy. The only way to keep
a monkey baby from playing is to hogtie him, and
tigers, lions, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars and all
the rest of the cat tribe play themselves into exhaustion.
Especially if some kind-hearted keeper has
tossed them a ball of catnip. But for the llama and
camel youngsters, there is no such thing in existence.
They know absolutely nothing about play! A gamboling
camel or a frolicking llama would send a
menagerie man to the doctor immediately to ask if
he’d been drinking too much.</p>

</figure>

<p>Instead, their sole amusement seems to be the
gratifying of curiosity: a trait overdeveloped in
childhood which departs entirely when they are
grown. This, coupled with a desire to see how
much rubbish, paper, trash, blankets and old bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
their stomachs can stand, appears to be the only
interesting part of childhood. Between the two, the
circus man prefers the llama, for it at least is a
gentle, pretty thing with some intelligence.</p>

<p>As for the baby camel—Here, ladies-s-s-s
an’ gents, is the prize fool of the whole animal kingdom.
When Nature devised the camel, somebody
carried away the brains, leaving the finished article,
especially in babyhood, the most idiotic, dunce-like
goof that ever struggled about on four legs. For
instance, in the cravings of its curiosity, the baby
camel may walk to a brick wall. It doesn’t go
round; it merely stands there, butting its head
against the obstacle, or standing in amazement,
waiting for the wall to move! When it isn’t doing
something like that, it is getting in the way of the
horses, the men, the elephants or anything else that
happens to come along, not because it is obstinate,
but simply because it doesn’t know enough to get
out of the way. When that diversion fails to interest,
it stands and bawls. Bawls for hours at a
time, apparently taking a wonderful delight in the
unmusical flatness of its voice.</p>

<p>While this is going on, the mother is bawling
also for her prize numskull to come again to her
side, a concert which continues for an hour or so
before the child finally understands that somebody
who feeds it desires its company at home. But
does the poor idiot obey the command? It does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
not. Frantically, and with an added bawling, it
goes to every other member of the camel herd before
it finds its own mother!</p>

<p>As a reward for which, the camel mother
promptly knocks down her senseless offspring,
spits at it and then bites it on the head, probably
knowing, in her motherly way, that there is less
sensitiveness there than anywhere else!</p>

<p>Another dumb one of the menagerie, although
in a different way, is the baby giraffe. There the
dumbness is actual. From the time of birth until
the time of death, not a sound ever comes from the
throat of a giraffe, with the result that the beasts
communicate evidently by some sign language, or
by an undiscovered sense of smell, for in some
strange way, the mother warns her baby of danger,
and that baby comes hurrying to her side!</p>

<p>Taken all in all, the giraffe is a peculiar beast
anyway. The cages in which those prized animals
of the Ringling-Barnum show are transported are
padded, top, side and bottom, and low enough to
almost touch the ground. All because there’s danger
at both ends. The giraffe’s legs are so long
that a troublesome step may break one of them and
cause the beast’s death. The useless horns, with
which the giraffe is born, are united to the skull and
so sensitive that a serious injury to one may mean
death also. On top of this, the things are so awkward
that they can stumble and fall while walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
on smooth ground! Besides that, they are so rare
and costly to catch and transport that the loss of
one means the dissipation of a young fortune. But
there’s one consoling thought, to the small boy, at
least. Giraffes love slippery elm bark.</p>

<p>As for other “freaks,” there are many of them:
the zebra, for instance, which seems to have been
born only for lion meat, and which, when a baby,
is abnormally strong, only to weaken as it grows
older; the kangaroo, which isn’t born at all, as a
real living thing, but which comes into the world
a mere lump of inanimate flesh, to be lifted by the
mother to the sac of her stomach, and to develop
there, until such time as it is able to shift for itself
and to feel the effects of vanity. For there is no
vainer animal living, not even the monkey. A
kangaroo or “wallaby” will remain quiescent all
day, until a crowd gets around its cage. Then like
any youngster, it will “show off” until absolutely
worn out.</p>

<p>But to get back to the subject of orphans, there
are such things even in the realm of elephantdom.
The prize one was Baby Miracle, the daughter of
Mr. Snyder and Mrs. Mamma Mary. But there
seemed to be something wrong about it all. Because
when Baby Miracle, all two hundred pounds
of her, came into being one spring day in winter
quarters at Denver, Colorado, Mamma Mary took
one look at what she had brought into the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and promptly kicked it across the menagerie house.</p>

<p>Which was hardly the way to treat a newcomer.
The animal men talked it over, chained the peevish
mother fore and aft, and sought a compromise.
They brought Baby Miracle forward to where the
mother could get a good look at her offspring,
and by gentle words tried to assure her that this
was her baby and should be treated as such.
Mamma Mary took a good survey this time, then
broke her chains and smashed a hole in the side
of the brick building as she made her get-away.
By now it was more than evident that Mamma
Mary wasn’t pleased with what she had done.
Nor was Baby Miracle terribly interested. She
merely rolled her eyes, wobbled her bit of a trunk,
and squealed in a fashion which might mean
anything.</p>

<p>So, while half the menagerie force went forth
to corral Mamma Mary, the other half hid Baby
Miracle and decided what should be done. The
most important thing, of course, was food. Fred
Alispaw, the superintendent, got an idea, rushed
for a telephone, called the biggest dairy company,
and ordered a milking machine. In the meanwhile,
Baby Miracle had given a squawk or two
of disgust and flopped to a pile of canvas, where
it tried to die while three animal keepers massaged
it to keep up circulation and a veterinary gave it a
strychnine injection.</p>

<p class="caption">LION TRIPLETS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>By this time Mamma Mary and the milking machine
had arrived at the menagerie house almost
simultaneously. The contraption was brought forth
and hooked on, while Mamma Mary rolled her eyes
and appeared to wonder what it was all about.
When the thing began to work she evidently came to
some conclusion, celebrating her discovery by kicking
over the machine, knocking down the three men
who were endeavoring to manipulate it, and for
good measure overturning a tiger den. Which
added to the general celebration.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Baby Miracle was having another
sinking spell and things were becoming serious.
The rest of the herd was called into action
to save the baby’s life. Mamma Mary was
chained fore, aft, and sideways to other elephants,
each with his trainer to hold him in place, and the
milking machine once more was installed. This
time enough milk was obtained to give Baby Miracle
a little confidence in this turbulent existence
into which she had entered, and infant elephant
stock ran higher.</p>

<p>It continued to soar for three days. Then
Mamma Mary discovered that she could strain her
muscles to such an extent that the machine could
milk and milk and continue to milk without results.
Which she did, and the machine went back to the
dairy company. However, by this time, Baby
Miracle had assumed a sort of don’t-care attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and was willing to try anything once. The first
was a bottle equipped with a regular “calf nipple”
and filled with a combination of one pint of cow’s
milk, mixed with condensed cream, topped off by
a pint of rice gruel, fed by the pouring system. All
of which, it was found, must be heated to a temperature
of 85 degrees. It appears that even baby
elephants have their tastes.</p>

<p>Again everything looked rosy, and after a week
or so, an attempt was made to put the disowned
child with the herd. But inasmuch as Mamma
Mary again took a look at her child and knocked
down two elephants in her attempts to murder it,
other plans were decided upon. Baby Miracle
was put into a padded cage where she got her bottle
and her gruel every four hours, until she finally
refused.</p>

<p>Somebody thought of goat’s milk, and two
tuberculin tested goats were purchased. The
goats were willing, but Baby Miracle wasn’t. So
the goats were sold.</p>

<p>Then it was discovered that Baby Miracle liked
ice-cream cones, and there was joy again. The
milk in these would be nourishing, and with a pint
or so of boiled rice, things might be better.</p>

<p>But they weren’t. After the menagerie superintendent
had poured castor oil down the child’s
throat for a day and a half in an attempt to bring
it back to normalcy, he guessed that he’d better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
cut out the cones. There was only one thing left,—the
advertised baby foods. All of which were
tried, with results not so good. So, in desperation,
Alispaw experimented again with the original concoction,
and Baby Miracle responded.</p>

<p>All her previous dislike vanished, she was given
a nurse from among the menagerie attendants, who
took her for walks by day and slept in her cage by
night. She learned to play with a rope, to amuse
herself by wadding up a mass of hay and throwing
it high into the air, while the watchful Lonnie,
her keeper, pried open her jaws after each experiment
to see that she’d gotten none of the nasty
stuff in her throat. But it was all no use.
Twenty-three weeks passed in which “the millionaire
baby,” as she was called around the show,
received every attention. Every possible thing
was guarded against; the veterinary passed up
other cases to watch the progress of Baby Miracle.
Even her food was weighed, to see how much of it
her stomach was assimilating. In reward for
which, Baby Miracle showed up one day with a
hacking cough and passed onward, perhaps the only
elephant in captivity to live twenty-three weeks on
a circus without having tasted the delights of a
peanut.</p>

<p>Quite different was the story of Rusty. Baby
Miracle weighed two hundred pounds, got every
possible attention and finally was stuffed to grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the reception room of a big Western newspaper until
a heartless mob came along and carried poor Baby
Miracle away to an unknown resting spot.
Rusty weighed about a pound and a half, but he
had his own ideas about getting along in life.
He was a tiny rhesus monkey, undersized even for
that species, and the object of torment for the
whole cage. His mother was tubercular; this
disease causes the death of nearly ninety per cent.
of the rhesus monkeys brought to this country.
She was too weak to defend it. The result being
that Rusty was picked on by every member of the
big cage, bitten, twitted, tormented, even by its own
father. Then, one day, the mother died.</p>

<p>The baby clung to the body of its sole protector
until the menagerie men took the inanimate body
away. Then, a tiny mite in the midst of a horde
of ruffians, Rusty strove to stand his ground. In
vain. His own father, one of the “cage bosses,”
led in the ruffianism, pulling out his hair, snarling at
him, biting him and slapping him. Rusty went
from grating to grating, from trapeze to bar, while
the rest of the cage followed him, with the exception
of one, a female who a month or so before had
lost her own baby. And Rusty, as he fled chattered
to her, grinned at her, then when the tormenting
reached its highest pitch, jumped straight for
her, snuggling into her arms.</p>

<p>For a moment she did not respond. But Rusty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
chattered on. The “cage bosses”—every monkey
house has three or four of these bullies who appear
to take a delight in making life as rough as possible
for the weaker ones—gathered about him,
pulling and picking at him, and incidentally taking
a few pokes at the babyless monkey who had allowed
him to come to her arms. For just so long
she stood it, her arms gradually tightening about
the little orphan. Then, at last, the mother nature
of her reached the ascendency.</p>

<p>That was a bad day for the bosses. She bit
them until their sides were red with blood. Larger
than ordinary and stronger, she knocked them from
one side of the cage to the other, chased them to
the trapezes, and clung by her teeth to any legs
that happened to be trailing; finally she drove the
whole outfit into a corner, there to chatter her
defiance to them in a monkey harangue that evidently
had some purpose—and wonderful results.
Rusty never was bothered again. What is more,
the stepmother accepted him as her own child, and
affectionate mother and good son—as simians go—they
still occupy the monkey house in peace.</p>

<p>So goes the story of the menagerie kid; but
varied as the youthful occupants of the cages may
be, there is one thing in which they share alike,
the kindergarten. Their schooling begins almost
the moment they are able to understand; the fool
camel is “halter broke” so his mother can bite him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
on the head at will; the lions, tigers, leopards and
other cat animals are taught not to “fight” the
feeding fork or the cage scrapers, by which the dens
are cleaned; the monkeys are taught not to reach
between the bars of their cage; the hippopotamus
is brought out of its den as often as possible, so
that it will not shake itself to death in fear of
the menagerie crowds—for the hippo is the most
easily frightened of all animals; the elephant is
made “hook-wise,” or taught that the pointed bull-hook
is merely a thing devised to guide it and not
something to cause pain; the zebra is walked time
and again past the lion cages to assure him that the
inmates will not kill him, and so it goes throughout
the whole list, each animal being taught the rudiments
which he must know before any kind of
arena training can even be considered. Withal, it
is a tedious task, expressed best perhaps by one of
the menagerie attendants during the auspicious advent
of Baby Miracle:</p>

<p>“Gosh! I sure wish all these here punk animals
could be borned grown up!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE DOG WAGON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NIGHT on the circus lot. The big top,
shadowy, dim, even in the glare of the
electric arcs atop the ticket wagon, had
fallen, now to lay, a flattened mushroom upon the
ground, while hurrying canvasmen unfastened the
lacings, and the barking lot superintendent prepared
for the lowering of the poles. One by one
the big wagons were trucking toward the first
smoking torch at a corner of the grounds, the beacon
light to guide tired horses and men toward the
loading runs, half a mile away. The “led stock”
and “ring stock” already had made its way toward
the horse cars. The “bull cars” were loaded, except
for the three work-elephants which had been
left on the lot for emergency, and which now, gray
hulks against the shafts of light, were released at
last, and obedient to the hook of the bull-man, were
trundling in satisfied fashion toward their rest
for the night. The menagerie superintendent
approached.</p>

<p>“That mutt still on the job?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>The bull-tender nodded.</p>

<p>“Yeh—over there.”</p>

<p>Something stirred in the shadows, came forward
a few steps, hesitated, then hurried into hiding
again. The superintendent grunted.</p>

<p>“Looks okay. Watch him at the cars. If he
stacks up, join him out.”</p>

<p>Again a nod. Then the elephant line went on,
while the shadowy trailer followed in the darkness,
fearful of coming too close, yet equally fearful,
it seemed, of dropping too far behind. It had
been thus for three nights now—a disappearance in
the daytime, a reappearance at night, when the
steel loading runs were down and the railroad
yards a clatter of shouts and grinding steel, as,
one after another, the wagons of the big show were
loaded for the night.</p>

<p>Down into the glare of the electric lights and the
carbides. Down to the shouts of the razorbacks
and “polers,” the clatter of wagons, the hollow
pounding of horses traveling up the runs to the
stock cars. At last the “bull” or elephant car.
The three big hulks clambered upward—and the
bull-man waited, standing far aside in the darkness.
Again a moment of hesitation, then a creeping
something came forward, to slink to the runway, to
pause, one foot slightly raised in preparation for
progress or flight; but there came no sound from
the bull-man; nothing save the shifting of the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
brutes within the car and the crunching of hay.
The interloper took a step forward, paused again,
moved on once more, then with a sudden dart was
inside the car and hidden in the hay. The bull-man
turned.</p>

<p>“Hey, Deafy!” he called to a passing property
man. “Tell that there dog punk I can fill up that
empty compartment in the wagon to-morrow. Just
joined one out.”</p>

<p>Which meant that the next day there would be a
new occupant for the dog wagon of the circus, a
new applicant for training, a new “trouper” among
the canine personnel of the show. One that would
respond to every command, for the simple reason
that he had chosen his own life; that he had run
away with the circus because he loved it and wanted
it, because he was a circus dog at heart, with the
love of trouping ingrained within him. Without
knowing it, he had passed an examination and
proved himself worthy of a life where there can
be no weaklings. The dog wagon of a circus is the
custodian of many a dog history, and of the inside
story of many a queer quirk in a dog nature. And
to the name of practically every occupant can be
placed the notation, “Present through his own
knowledge and desire.”</p>

<p>To those of you who watch the various trained-dog
acts of a circus, it may seem a difficult thing
to procure the various performers; perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
you’ve often wondered where they came from, how
they were trained; and in some cases you may have
sorrowed a bit at the “poor animals” forced to
travel day by day, earning their living by the
performance of their tricks. All of which is very
sweet and pretty, but it is wrong in one particular.
In seventy-five cases out of a hundred, the circus dog
is there either because he has insisted on being there,
and persisted even in undergoing hardships to be
able to pass his examination, or because the fact
that he was wanted by the circus has saved him
from the chloroform room of the pound-keeper.
The circus dog as a general rule comes from only
two sources,—the dog pound, or the voluntary “joining
out” of a canine who comes to the circus of his
own accord and insists upon staying with it, even
to the extent of “bumming” his way from town to
town! With the exception of the twenty-five per
cent. representing the dogs belonging to the individual
performers, which perhaps have been purchased
from other performers, or trainers, or which,
like their human counterparts of the circus world,
are of a long string of performing ancestors, the offspring
taking up the life of their forbears and
“carrying on the act.” In these instances, the
values run high; Alf Loyal’s dogs, for instance, with
the Ringling Brothers-Barnum and Bailey Circus,
are worth a young fortune, while Abe Aronson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
“rabbit” and “elephant” dogs are insured for several
thousand dollars. The same is true of other canine
troupes belonging to individuals. But even here
and there among these valued dogs are others, performing
as well and valued as highly, whose past
could be written in a continuous chapter of back
alleys and weird escapes from the dog catcher.</p>

<p>Nor is every dog which joins the circus taken
along merely as a performer. Quite the opposite.
There are often more canines outside the ring
around a big show, each with his or her job, than
ever appear under the big top. There is the elephant
dog, for instance, trained to remain around
the big animals, to trot under their heels, to appear
without warning from one side or another, or to
stand in front of them and bark or snarl, to sleep
with them in the big bull car at nights, and chief of
all, to keep other dogs from the vicinity of that herd.
Upon that dog, usually a nondescript, does the
safety of the show often rest, and for one very
good reason: elephants seem to form a strange
fascination for dogs, while to an elephant, a dog is a
fearsome beast, breeding fear and trepidation, and
forming one of the best excuses ever invented for
a panic! Hence the elephant dog, to which the
big mammals become accustomed, and upon which
they eventually come to look upon as a sort of
protector, acting in the final analysis in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
same fashion as a pacifier to a mammoth baby.</p>

<p>Then too, there are the menagerie dogs; just
dogs, with apparently no purpose in life except to
trot around the menagerie tent, or sleep beneath
a cage. But they all have their duties. There
are the ones which accompany the led stock—any
animal which can be led by a halter is known in
the circus as “led” stock—and which know every
member of that department. More than once,
when on the check-up at night, a zebra or llama is
found to be missing, the led stock dog has departed
also, not to appear again until that missing
animal is accounted for and presented at the runs,
with the dog nipping at its heels! In circus history
there is even the case of Scotty, a little Scotch
terrier rescued from a dog pound, her puppies
chloroformed, and a baby lion given into her keeping
to raise. Which task she performed with the
result that Kaiser is now a feature lion of the menagerie
of a big circus, while Scotty sleeps in a
little silk-lined casket, her life shortened because of
her faithful sacrifices to a king of beasts.</p>

<p>Around the menagerie it seems that the dog
forms the natural companion for any animal. No
matter whether its breed be feline or canine, equine
or bovine, when a companion is needed, a new dog
is added to the circus roster. Seldom does that
dog fail, even though the course of its faithfulness
should lead to danger or even to death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Not so many years ago, one of the feminine
trapeze performers of a western circus was crossing
the lot to her evening meal in the cookhouse,
when suddenly she turned with the knowledge of
something trailing at her heels. A moment more
and she had halted, to survey in pitying fashion
a small, woolly, half-starved mongrel, which, with
whining and excessive wagging of tail, was seeking
to inveigle her into a capture. But dogs, as pets,
are not welcomed on a circus. The trapeze performer
shook her head.</p>

<p>“Run along, pups!” she commanded, “I can’t
take you!”</p>

<p>To which the mongrel paid no attention whatever.
He had determined that here was surcease
from hunger and privations, and he persisted in
his appeals. The circus woman shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well,” came finally, “I guess I can get you a
square meal anyway.”</p>

<p>Whereupon she gathered him in her arms, hid
him under the loose dressing-room cape which she
was wearing, smuggled him into the cookhouse and
surreptitiously fed him.</p>

<p>By that time, the pup had won his battle. Once
out of the cookhouse, the performer hurried to the
dog wagon. But the “dog boy” shook his head.
In the first place, the circus didn’t need any more
dogs, and besides that, every compartment in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
wagon—a regular circus vehicle fitted with thirty or
more small, square boxes which, bedded with straw,
form a resting place for the show canines at night—was
filled. The performer turned toward the
menagerie and its superintendent. There a different
welcome was waiting.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said the menagerie boss, “just what
I’ve been looking for. First day this season there
haven’t been a dozen dogs hanging around, waiting
to be picked up. Always happens, just when you
need ’em worst. I’ve got to have a companion
for that Pat kangaroo. Lucy, his mate, died this
morning.”</p>

<p>So a bargain was made that the new dog should
be the companion of Pat, the kangaroo, from
evening until after parade time in the mornings,
when it was to go into the keeping, for the afternoon
hours, of the performer who had rescued it
from starvation. Into the kangaroo cage went the
little woolly mongrel, to bark in excited fashion for
a few moments, then to edge forward in gingerly
survey of the timid, grieving thing, which, by this
time, had retreated to the farthest part of its cage.
There was an exchange of dog and kangaroo
courtesies, and evidently a few greetings in the
universal language of animaldom. Late that
night, when the superintendent inspected the boarding
up of the various dens, there lay Pat and
Dingy as he had been christened, fast asleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Friendship had been effected, and the life of a
kangaroo saved. For a time, at least. But
tragedy was in the offing.</p>

<p>The next day the performer came for her dog,
to take it to the dressing tent, there to pet and feed
it, while in the menagerie a kangaroo watched in
timid, excited fashion for its return. Night came,
and the dog was restored to the den, to hurry to its
strange cage-mate and frolic about it, while the
kangaroo gave a greeting equally effusive. It was
the beginning of a routine which progressed to such
an extent that there came the time when the performer
had only to release the dog from its chain
in the dressing tent and turn to her work of packing,
safe in the knowledge that Dingy would take
a straight line for the menagerie and the kangaroo
cage, there to stand and bark until some attendant
opened the door and lifted him within. Then came
tragedy.</p>

<p>One night the circus reeled and tossed and
struggled in the midst of a storm. Peaks lowered,
workers struggling about in mud to their knees,
horses hook-roped to every wagon, work-elephants
wallowing through the mire, the big show strove its
best to free itself from the stickiness of a “soft
lot” and hurry on to make good the next-day promises
of the billboards, a hundred and fifty miles
away. In the menagerie, the last of the dens was
being boarded up, when an attendant suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
paused, looked within, then hurried for the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“Dingy ain’t showed up yet,” he announced.
“Ain’t seen nothin’ of him, an’ Pat’s jumpin’ around
his cage an’ barkin’—all excited. It’s way past
time for Dingy—I guess he knows it.”</p>

<p>The superintendent gave an order.</p>

<p>“Tear over to the dressing tent, quick. Maybe
Miss Laird didn’t turn him loose.”</p>

<p>But the menagerie boy returned with the report
that Dingy had started from the dressing tent at
his usual hour, apparently on his customary beeline
for the kangaroo cage. There was only one
explanation: the dog had decided upon a different
life and had deserted the show. Up went the
boards of the kangaroo cage, the animal leaping
excitedly about within, emitting its queer, frightened
bark, sure evidence that it too knew something
was wrong. All the way to the runs it continued to
thump about, to cry out, but there was no remedy.
Dingy was gone.</p>

<p>An hour later, at the elephant cars, the superintendent,
muddy, bedraggled, tired, was watching
the loading of the last bull. There came the dim
view of a moving figure in the darkness, then the
voice of the menagerie boy.</p>

<p>“Got your spotlight, Boss?” he asked. “I got
Dingy here. Found him down at the main runs—crawled
all the way, I guess. Smashed up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>There came the gleam of electricity, then a long
moment of silence. Dingy had not run away. Instead,
in the muddiness and darkness of the circus
lot, he evidently had floundered in the course of a
plunging, struggling team. Half of his left side,
and of his left hind leg, was literally torn away.
Evidently the menagerie had departed when he had
summoned the strength to reach the place where it
had rested that day. But he had followed, crawling,
for nearly a mile to the circus runs.</p>

<p>Dingy died that night. Pat died three weeks
later, refusing the companionship of another dog,
refusing food, even water. Animal grief, so menagerie
men will tell you, is the most intense grief
in all the world.</p>

<p>Nor do animals easily forget their cage-mates,
especially dogs. Out on the Selig Zoo in Los
Angeles are a lioness and a dog living in the same
cage, against every effort of the keepers. They
were born on the same day, several years ago, and
each later became motherless. In an effort to
maintain the life of each through companionship,
they were placed together and grew to maturity.
Then there came the fear that canine and feline
nature would assert itself, with a consequent battle
and death, with the results that efforts were made
to separate the pair.</p>

<p>They took the dog away, far into another part
of the gardens, and there gave it luxuries it never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
had known before. But the dog did not want
luxuries. It wanted only that lion. While, in the
lion’s den, a tawny beast roared and bellowed and
beat itself against the bars in a fury of excitement;
nor could even the distance of the width of the
gardens really separate them. The dog could hear
the roaring of the lion, and answered in staccato
barks and in howlings. The lioness caught the call
and answered in turn. Day and night it was the
same. The menagerie men returned them to each
other, waited a week and attempted it once more.
In vain. Then, for a space of three months, they
tried a scheme of separation, for an hour at a time,
then two hours, then three, with success apparently
before them. But when the first separation of a
night came, the old remonstrance began again and
was continued. They were partners, that lioness
and that dog, and partners they are to-day, their
battle won, cage-mates forever as far as the menagerie
men are concerned. The dog appears perfectly
happy. It has no desires for the usual canine
pleasures; running and playing mean nothing to it.
It has a cage nature, a cage appearance, if such a
thing can be, and it cares for nothing except the
company of its leonine companion.</p>

<p>But to return to the circus and its dogs, and
its methods of gaining possession of them. One
hears much of the boy who runs away to join the
circus, a thing which rarely happens, for circuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
are business institutions. In the first place, they
don’t want young boys. They need persons grown
to sufficient strength to possess the necessary muscle
to endure the hardships and work of a circus lot,
and that strength doesn’t come until a boy is old
enough to go about where he chooses. One hears
little of the dogs which run away with a circus, and
yet there is a set formula about the menagerie, a
question asked almost daily:</p>

<p>“Shall we watch for a mutt to-day?”</p>

<p>Because there is hardly a day in which some dog
does not attempt to “join out,” and through his
own efforts, seek to attach himself to the show.
For all of it there is a reason. If there is one thing
that a dog loves, it is horses. If there is another,
it is the sound of a band. And if there is a third,
it is a general air of excitement and hurly-burly.
The next time the circus comes to town, watch the
band wagons of the parade. You’ll find in the
wake, at the sides, and at the rear, a collection of
from one to twenty dogs, trotting happily along,
tongue lolling from open jaws, tail aloft, step as
springy as that of a high-school horse in the ring.
The circus represents to the average dog a sort
of heaven where things go exactly the way he
wants them to go, and he deliberately chooses the
show as a permanent place of abode and insists
upon his choice until the circus allows him his
desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>For the dog who goes to the circus undergoes a
period of apprenticeship which lasts for days and
for hundreds of miles of travel. The “likely” dog
usually follows the parade to the circus grounds,
there to loaf about under the cages, or trail some
particular hostler or menagerie man until that person
takes cognizance of him. Which doesn’t happen
until night comes, when the circus has traveled
to the train, and the dog is still in evidence.</p>

<p>If the circus is “full up,” the dog stays behind.
But if there is an opening for a good, faithful dog
that likes the show life, there is a gruff command
just as the “high-ball” signal sounds, then a scramble
as the dog is tossed to one of the flat cars, there to
find a bed as best he may, beneath a wagon, or upon
a pile of canvas. Thus he spends his first night, in
the open upon a jolting flat car, with every possible
opportunity to think it all over and decide whether
or not he really wants this rough-and-tumble existence.
The next morning, when the circus goes to
the lot—and if he goes with it—he may be fed or
he may not. Usually not. If that dog wants the
circus life sufficiently, he’ll find a way to exist and to
remain. When night comes again, if he is a weakling,
he’ll not be present at the loading runs, having
found an easier existence. But in nine cases out
of ten, there he’ll be, whining and begging to be put
aboard again. When the third night comes, he
usually discovers a means of getting aboard himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and when he shows up on the fourth morning,
satisfied and happy, there is a gruff verdict, and a
new occupant for the dog wagon. He has won his
place as a circus dog, just as any candidate wins a
position, through merits, and being the “dog fitted
for the place.”</p>

<p>So much for the dog which voluntarily “joins
out.” The other type—the one which comes to
the circus as a result of a circus demand—is
perhaps a far more fortunate creature, even though
he doesn’t know it. For he has been saved from
death; his place of collection is the dog pound.</p>

<p>Only the mutt, the mongrel, the dog which by
his actions, his appearance and his mannerisms displays
plainly that he is only a stray and worthless,
so far as dogs go, is allowed to “join out” in the
usual fashion. The circus doesn’t care for lawsuits,
or be attached in the next town for having
“stolen” the pedigreed pet of some mourning dog-owner.
The result is that a dog with a collar, or
one which appears too sleek or well fed, is not welcome
about a circus lot. The friendship of the
hostler, the performer or the menagerie man is not
for him. It is too dangerous; and besides, there
is an easier way,—the dog pound.</p>

<p>There the circus man goes to look over the
collection of animals which have been picked up on
the streets, and for which the time-limit for
redemption has passed. For certain acts, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
must be certain dogs; for “pad work,” where the
dog seizes the clown by the seat of the trousers, or
does a “strong-jaw” act all his own, by being pulled
to the top of the tent while hanging by his teeth to
a leather pad, there must be the bull dog, preferably
a large-sized, not-too-highly-bred dog of the Boston
bull type. For the races there must be Russian
wolf hounds; for hind-leg walking, there must be
the collie or the Spitz; while for general, all-round
performing excellence, there are the fox terriers.
And around the circus, you’ll find many a pedigreed
dog of these various species, but rarely a dog with
a pedigree. Their pasts are hidden, owner and
ancestor. The pound-keeper usually forms the
wall between.</p>

<p>Nor is the dog which comes to the big show a
circus dog immediately upon his arrival. Instead,
for a week or so, he is a dejected individual, snarled
at, mistreated by the rest of the pack, tied to his
own picket pin, apart from the remainder at feeding
time, jailed in his compartment of the dog wagon
when the rest are liberated. And all for the reason
that there is nothing so clannish as the dog pack
of a circus. Some way, the members of that pack
seem to realize that they are occupants of a different
life; apart from the common, ordinary dog which
knows only a home and a master. A circus dog
never fights singly. He has the whole pack to back
him, the wolf instinct strongly to the fore. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a town dog crosses the trail of a circus dog, it is
usually a battle to the death.</p>

<p>Therefore, until the regular pack becomes accustomed
to the new arrival, he is nothing but a hated
“towner,” regarded with the strange sense of enmity
which runs all the way through the circus world.
Day after day, however, the other dogs see the newcomer
taken into the ring during the interim
between the matinée and the night show, for training.
Gradually there comes the understanding
that he too is a circus dog; then the growling and
snarling ceases. No longer does he stand apart at
his picket pin. He is a part of the pack, as ready
as any of the rest to set upon and kill any “towner
dog” that comes his way.</p>

<p>And once a circus dog, always a circus dog, for
the instinct never dies, even though it may lead
into strange channels; once, in fact, to a story of
dogdom that has had few equals even in fiction,—the
narrative of Nosey, and an instinct of the
spring, when circus loves comes strongest, which
turned her to a thing of the wild, never to reach
civilization again. Somewhere now, in the wild
country of Northwestern Colorado, where the
mountainous rises stretch mile on mile, where there
are still bears to be found in the berry patches at
autumn, and the deer and elk crash through the
underbrush about the great rock-slides, is Nosey,
no longer a dog as dogs go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Perhaps the story is best from the beginning. No
one except a circus man really understands the
importance of a dog to an elephant herd. It means
as much as steam gauge to a boiler, or a steering
wheel to an automobile. If there is anything in
the world that an elephant loves, it is to become
frightened. The old story of the mouse and the
elephant is true to a certain extent, and the thing of
things with which to shake an elephant absolutely
from his foundations is a dog. Perhaps it is a
natural antipathy: perhaps it is the fact that dogs
have a habit of going where they choose and since
elephants are so big and cumbersome that they cannot
readily see behind them, they are more easily
frightened by something woolly darting between
their legs, or appearing apparently from nowhere
under their trunks.</p>

<p>However, a dog is the elephant’s Nemesis, and
to the wise circus man, the only cure is the disease
itself. Hence every menagerie has several non-descripts
whose sole job is to be constantly about
the elephants, and by their presence to reassure the
great beasts and keep them reminded that the things
which are moving about them are only dogs and
not some fearsome thing to start them on a panic.
At the loading runs, of all places, are those dogs
necessary; otherwise, a dog fight, or the appearance
of any street mongrel, might start a stampede that
would wreck a town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>It happened one night on a big show, shortly
before the close of the season in 1916—the town
was a small place in Texas—that the menagerie
superintendent noticed something small and yellow
stealthily following the elephant herd from the
grounds to the loading runs, there to evade the
protective sallies of the old elephant dog, and dart
first toward one elephant man, then another, in an
effort to gain at least momentary notice. But the
show was “full up” on dogs; the menagerie superintendent
had given orders only that morning that
no more were to be taken on. Besides, the bull-men
saw that the intruder was undoubtedly of good
stock, a half-grown female of the Chow breed, and
circus men, as has been mentioned before, are skittish
of pedigreed volunteers. So they merely
shunted the dog aside, and with gruff commands
drove her from the runways when she sought to
evade them and crawl into the elephant car. Finally
the doors were closed, the tired elephant men went
to their bunks, and the little waif was left in
darkness.</p>

<p>But luck played with her. She remained beside
the elephant car, waiting, whining. A passing
“razorback” or car-loader halted, reflected a moment,
decided that one of the show’s elephant dogs
had been forgotten in the loading, and tossed her
upon a flat car. The next morning, surprised
elephant men noticed her again “on the lot,” a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
hundred miles from their starting point of the night
before, loitering at the edge of the canvas, peeking
through when the wind raised the side walls, then
at times seeking to come within, only to be driven
away by the old elephant dog, watchful of every
passing canine. That night she again waited in
the darkness, and the next morning—how no one
knows—she once more made her appearance on a
show grounds, seventy-five miles farther on.</p>

<p>It was too much persistence even for a circus that
didn’t need an extra dog. The elephant men halted
now and then in their work to give her a pat
of encouragement. Even the old elephant dog
relented, and watchful, a bit suspicious in his hospitality,
allowed her to come within the menagerie
tent and sit for a few moments at the head of the
picket line. A week later Nosey had won her
place with the show, for the rest of the season at
least.</p>

<p>Nosey because she had nosed her way into the
circus, nosed her way into the cookhouse, where she
had inveigled the busy chefs and hurrying flunkeys
to toss her enough food to sustain life, nosed her
way past the guardianship of the elephant dog and
into the affections of the menagerie men. For the
rest of the season and the winter, at least, she was
installed as a fixture, and when the show went into
quarters at Denver, Nosey went also, content to
bed herself down in an unobtrusive corner, to live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
upon the droppings from the chopping blocks as
the menagerie men cut the daily food of the lions,
tigers and other cats, content with anything, so that
she might be near the things she loved,—the inmates
of the animal house. Through the winter the world
was hers; then spring came.</p>

<p>There was no room for Nosey this season. The
animal superintendent scratched his head, considered
long, then telephoned a doctor who lived in a suburb,
some ten miles from town. She’d have a good
time there; the doctor drove to winter quarters,
took Nosey into his arms and his heart, and
departed. The show went forth to the road. A
month passed. Then came a sorrowful letter from
Denver. The dog had disappeared from her new
home. Shortly afterward a policeman had reported
that he had been forced to kill a dog of her description
because of the evidences of rabies. Around
the menagerie the word passed that Nosey was
dead.</p>

<p>On went the show, to its sallies into the North,
its quick spurts into the moneyed territories in the
East, the long trail through the small town of the
“Death Trail” on its way to the Western coast, and
finally into the far South for the end of its season.
Once more the railroad yards of Denver were cluttered
with wagons and horses and tableaus, scarred
from the mud and tribulations of bad lots and long
hauls; it was November again; the circus was home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
for the long months of winter, and the hurried activities
of refurnishing that it might be ready for
the road when the bluebirds sang again. And with
the arrival of the first wagon at winter quarters
a gaunt, half-starved thing darted from her position
at the animal-house door, closed and locked
until the menagerie superintendent should arrive.
She weaved in wild circles, rushing to the horses,
then darting away again, running to the door of
the animal house, whining, scratching, then swerving
away once more; a beast which acted as one
crazed, circling and twisting in a perfect hysteria
of excitement. The long line of elephants came up
the snowy street; the dog yowled and barked,
rushed to the animal men, then whirled away again.
The bull line was halted. Word was rushed to the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“There’s a mad dog in the yard there. Better
bump it off before it stampedes these here
bulls.”</p>

<p>The superintendent reached into a wagon box
for his revolver, then carefully went forward.
The dog sighted him, barked joyously, then once
more began those excitement-crazed circles, a
gaunt, weakened thing which swirled again and
again, at last to drop from sheer exhaustion. The
revolver was raised. The superintendent stepped
forward—closer—closer—then halted!</p>

<p>Nosey! he called in surprised tones, and strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
came once more to the weakened dog. She turned;
then crawling, she made her way to him, to lick his
hands, cry and whine her happiness, then with
wavering steps to turn again toward the menagerie
house door. The superintendent whirled.</p>

<p>“Bring on those bulls,” he shouted. “There
isn’t anything wrong with this dog, except that it’s
half-starved.”</p>

<p>The door of the animal house was unlocked.
In shot the dog, to make the rounds of the place,
to investigate everything with quick sniffings, even
to refuse food in her excitement, and at last to
flop exhausted upon a pile of hay at the end of the
picket line. When visiting neighbors, welcoming
the circus home again, came that afternoon to
winter quarters, they told the true story of Nosey,
the story of a shadowy canine which had appeared
three months before at winter quarters, which had
refused every approach of friendship lest she again
be taken from the place she loved; which had
haunted the place day and night, gaining her food
as best she could, evading every living thing until
she had become known to the whole neighborhood
as “The Phantom Dog.” The policemen
had made a mistake in his description; Nosey had
merely gone back to her circus, content to starve if
need be, in waiting for its return.</p>

<p>There was no question about her place with the
show now. She was the circus favorite, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
big bull herd as her especial charge. There even
came the time when jealousy arose between her and
Mutt, the regular elephant dog, a duel which was
fought out; then Mutt decided to take up another
position in the menagerie, leaving Nosey in supreme
command.</p>

<p>She ran that elephant herd as a general would
command an army. She went with them to the
cars at night, she saw that they were loaded; then
crawled in with them—the herd mascot. She
guarded them during the day; the first sally of a
town dog toward them meant a slashing attack
which invariably sent the intruder hurrying away,
happy to be anywhere except around elephants.
When circus visitors approached too close for their
own safety, it was Nosey, who, with a snarl, sent
them back to a common-sense position. A stampede
happened; an elephant was lost. It was
Nosey who trailed her, rushed back to the circus
lot, found the superintendent, then led him to where
the stray had been located. There came the time
when Nosey even went into the ring with her big
charges. Then came a change.</p>

<p>The superintendent and his wife decided to leave
the circus and live upon a ranch, far in the Elkhorn
Range in Northwestern Colorado. Nosey, with
two other circus dogs, was taken along. It was
winter; the temperature went to thirty and forty
below; Nosey apparently was content to remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in the warm ranch house and wait for spring, when
undoubtedly there would be the circus again.</p>

<p>When the warm days came, when the snow of
the high range began to crust, making travel easy,
Nosey would wander forth, look down into the
warmer country below, then turn to her master and
mistress in pitiful whining; as if to ask when they
would troupe again, when the band would play
once more. But there was only the work of the
ranch, never the sound of music, nor the blatter of
the midway. One day Nosey was missing.</p>

<p>For two days they saw nothing of her. Then
one morning, the former superintendent, traveling
the miles to the mail box on the main road, saw
a wary coyote pack, and with it something yellow
and furry, unlike the rest. He called to her, and
Nosey came forward, wagging her tail, apparently
content to accompany him once more. For two
days she remained at home, then once more disappeared.
This time for the summer.</p>

<p>They did not see her again until late the next
fall, when, as though she never had been away, she
trotted into the house, made the rounds of the
place, nipped at the trousers leg of the former
superintendent, ran out the door, came back, ran
away again, and returned in an effort to lead the
man forth. At last he followed, with his wife,
far over the hills, to a hollow log where Nosey
halted in proud maternity. Within, yowling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
tumbling, were four half-breed coyote puppies.</p>

<p>They gathered up the babies and took them
home, Nosey trotting happily beside them. But
again it was only a momentary return to civilization.
Once more she disappeared, taking her puppies
with her, this time in finality. Up there in the
Elkhorn a former menagerie superintendent and his
wife set out food when the heavy snows come and
scan the hills when the coyotes shriek, but Nosey
evidently has settled upon her own existence. Once
came a howling in the night, close to the house, a
track in the snow; but that was all. Nosey has
not been seen since the day she left with her puppies,
to “troupe” with the coyotes.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite to the story of Nosey is that
of Mike, one of a trio of performing fox terriers
with a small circus. The day was unusually
hot and sultry; every animal on the show was tired
and logy—the trainers were as fatigued as the dogs.
In cracking his whip for the “flash” of the act,
the terrier trainer miscalculated and caught Mike
a terrific blow across the back and flanks.</p>

<p>The dog did not understand that it all was a mistake.
He only knew that he had been punished
when he did not deserve it. A yelp of pain, a rush
and he had disappeared from the ring, not to be
found again. The show left town, a new dog was
broken for the act, and Mike all but forgotten.</p>

<p>Two years later, the show returned to the stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
where Mike had disappeared. The same dog boy
was in charge of the wagon, the same trainer
handling his trio of fox terriers. Late afternoon
came, and with it a tramp fox terrier, dirty, bony,
and rough-coated, which trotted upon the circus
lot with an air of easy familiarity, sniffed about
the horse tents, investigated the dressing room,
then found the way to the dog boy and sought by
every possible form of dog language to make himself
known. For a long time it all was a mystery,
then the dog boy grinned.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mike!” he announced. “Decided to
come back, huh?”</p>

<p>Mike it was! What was more, when they took
him into the ring and gave him cues which he
had not heard in two years, he responded almost
immediately, doing his flips, stretching for the
“bridge” and returning to his various “stands” and
“set-ups” as though he never had been away.
Mike is still on the job with the circus; more,
so faithful is he that he is not confined at a picket
line as are the other dogs. He has had his taste
of the “towner’s world,” and the circus is all he
wants.</p>

<p>In fact, faithfulness seems to be the quality of
qualities with dogs who join the circus. Several
years ago, George Brown, an English clown, who
with his performing fox terriers long has been a
feature with all the big shows, was stricken with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
ptomaine poisoning and taken to the hospital.
That afternoon one of his dogs, whose act consisted
of being “dressed” in a miniature horse’s head and
tail, and doing a high-school act around the hippodrome
track, suddenly rebelled against the substitute
clown who had taken Brown’s place and
scurried under the side wall, horse’s head and all.
To the dressing tent he went, to dart in frenzied
fashion up and down the aisles of trunks, searching
for his master; then before any one could catch him,
once more he disappeared. That afternoon and
night a frantic dog boy and all of Clown Alley
searched in vain for George Brown’s dog. The circus
left town without him, and a frightened dog boy
waited in trembling for the return of the clown.
But when George Brown came back to the show,
there was the dog under his arm!</p>

<p>“I thought I had ’em,” he announced joyfully.
“It was two days after the show’d gone and I was
able to sit up. Happened to look out the window,
and there was a horse, about ten inches high, running
around the hospital lawn, like he was trying
to follow a trail. After I’d got my senses, I whistled.
Sure enough, it was the pup! Hadn’t had
anything to eat or drink for two days; was
just about gone when the nurse brought him in.
Couldn’t take anything, you know, on account of
that horse’s head over his own. Been following my
trail all the time, I guess. Next time I get sick,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and George Brown blinked slightly, “those pups
go with me!”</p>

<p>Nor is that instance any more marked than the
one of Ragsy, who was nothing to the circus, yet
everything. Ragsy belonged to a “skinner” or
teamster, and she had a place all her own in the
life of the big show. Circus folk live in a small
circle. The world is theirs to travel, yet the world
really means nothing to them; the happenings of
that little universe all their own are the ones which
really count, and every animal, every horse, every
trifling incident in that circus is a part of their lives.
Ragsy played a big part.</p>

<p>She appeared one morning as the horse tents
were being erected, one of the innumerable dog
waifs which always are about the show grounds.
A sorrel team seemed to attract her; she sat by it
while the horses fed, then when they were taken
forth to parade, she went with them, trotting beside
them as though she had done it all her life. A
queer, misshapen little thing she was, of Skye terrier
origin, and with an ingratiating, “doggy” manner,
which caused the driver to grin at her more
than once and call a word of encouragement as the
team started back to the circus grounds. Not that
Ragsy needed it; she had turned with the team and
when they rested again in the big horse tents, there
was Ragsy beside them. That night, when the
wagons were loaded and the big team had made its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
two trips to the runs, Ragsy was there also, at last
to brush against the leg of the driver as he watched
the loading of his stock and prepared to crawl into
the deck of the horse car above them, his usual
place of nightly abode. He started away, the plea
of the dog unnoticed, only to halt again. For she
had whined and pawed at him. The big “skinner”
paused in contemplation.</p>

<p>“All right,” came at last. “Guess that there
bunk’s big enough for me’n you.”</p>

<p>That night Ragsy snoozed contentedly; she had
joined the circus along with her beloved sorrels.
When dawn came, she was there beside them again,
not to leave them all day. Weeks passed. At last
there came an inspiration to the driver, and he
lifted the little Skye to the back of one of the
sorrels, balancing her there for a time until she
gained a footing.</p>

<p>“I’ll just make a parade feature outen her,” he
grinned to his fellow skinners, and the idea worked!
Ragsy fell off, but she was willing to try again and
again and again, until at last there came the time
when bugle call for parade meant as much to the
dog as to the performers. A jump to the double-trees,
then to the tongue; another leap, and she was
on the back of the wheel sorrel, there to balance
herself during parade, while the crowds along
the street gave credit to some circus trainer,
and the skinner, high atop his seat on the band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
wagon, grinned in satisfaction. For he and Ragsy
knew!</p>

<p>It became a matter of interest throughout the
circus, that affection of Ragsy for those sorrels.
When the big eight-horse team was taken to water,
there was Ragsy. When the night hauls came,
Ragsy was there too, at last to augment her parade
performance by riding wherever the big team went.
In mud or in rain, in storm or in sunshine, she never
left the big team. Those horses belonged to
Ragsy as much as to the circus!</p>

<p>One day there came a break in Ragsy’s usual
routine, that of watching the horses wherever they
went, even if only across a street. The show was
making a long jump; the stop for feeding and
watering was to be a short one, and the skinner,
fearful lest Ragsy be left behind when the “high-ball
signal” sounded, decided that she must stay in
the horse cars. The dog objected. There was
only one thing to do and with a halter rope the
skinner tied her in a manger, then hurried forth to
his work.</p>

<p>A half-hour later he returned with the horses,
started up the runway, halted, stared within, then
rushed forward to come forth a moment later, eyes
averted, hands slowly knitting a picture of mute
sorrow. Another driver halted him. A nod over
the shoulder, a voice gruffened to hide the choke
of it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I killed her. Dead—in there. Strangled
tryin’ t’ get out o’ that manger.”</p>

<p>They gathered from every part of the train, a
community rallying to a tragedy commensurate to
the size of its little world. An actor took off his
hat, tossed a dollar into it and began to make the
rounds. Within the car, the skinner had wrapped
the silent form of Ragsy in his coat and laid it
tenderly in his bunk on the deck above, to rest there
until such time as the labors of the circus might
give him a chance to bury her. That night, the
show at last placed upon the lot, the skinners
gathered, silent, hesitant men, talking in a low tone
as though they were in the presence of human death
instead of that of only an animal. Some one fashioned
a coffin. From the wardrobe wagon came
silken and soft materials, overflow from the making
of costumes; performers hurried from town with
flowers—even to a blanket of roses—and beside the
horse tents they put Ragsy away. And unless it
has been destroyed by some one who does not know
the circus heart, there still stands on a circus lot
in Southern Texas a heavy bit of yellow pine, with
rough words carved with a jackknife:</p>

KiLLed Sep. 12-19.<br>
SHe suRe Was Faithfull.</p>

<p>Faith—and no reward, save the glitter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
spangles, and blaring of bands; the noise of the big
top, the confusion of the midway; that, it seems, is
all that the circus dog wants. And, too, that love
seems to be in the heart of every dog; the parade is
always a conglomeration of “houn’s,” traveling in
the wake of the clown band wagon, or trotting beside
the horses. Nor is it necessary that the show
be an outdoor affair—just so it is a circus!</p>

<p>Last winter I was called back into the show business
for a brief season, that I might produce an
indoor circus for a Denver lodge. It was to be a
big affair, running to nearly a hundred thousand
dollars, and it was necessary that the coming show,
which was to be assembled from all parts of the
United States, have every bit of unusual publicity
possible. A member of the general committee,
Ted Syman, came forward with an idea.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with a hound-dog parade,
made up from mutts all over the city?” he asked.
“It’d give us a chance to carry publicity matter
through the streets, kids with banners and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>So the idea grew. There was to be a prize for
the muttiest mutt dog in town. A restaurant
keeper appeared, with an offer to buy the dog for
twenty-five dollars. As a further incentive to the
boys of town, the owner and winner was to be allowed
to appear at the head of the grand entry
each night with his dog. Nobody thought anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of how the mutt himself would react; he was only
a dog.</p>

<p>The parade was held. The mutt was selected, a
woolly, squatty, pig-eyed nondescript, dirty with the
smudges of alleys and coal holes, the muttiest mutt
dog in town. The restaurant keeper bought him,
for the advertisement of it, possession to be gained
at the end of the circus week. The performance
came. Dirt and all, the dog was turned over to the
clowns, four or five toy balloons attached to him, a
banner tied to his waving tail, and the clowns arranged
for an escort. The first entry came, and
into the big ring trotted the mutt with the clowns,
his former boy owner beside him, the clowns trooping
and frolicking about him, and the band blaring
behind him. There were lights, music, the lifting
step of horses, lumbering elephants; crowds, confusion;
soon we began to notice that the boy might
be a bit late at Clown Alley for his nightly decorations,
but never the dog. For it was the dog, we
saw, that was gaining continued enjoyment out of
it all. After the first few nights it all began to
pall upon the boy. But not the mutt. Twice a
night he made the circuit of that ring, banner-bedecked
tail waving in constant ecstasy, mouth
open in excited panting, short legs bobbing, eyes
gleaming. Twice a night for a week; then the
circus came to a close.</p>

<p>Performers hurried away to begin their regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
circus engagements. Horses, performing animals,
elephants and seals were loaded into railroad cars
for their trip back to winter quarters. The restaurant
keeper took his mutt and advertised it—for a
day. Then the dog disappeared.</p>

<p>But he did not go to the home of his former
owner. Instead, one night, nearly a week after the
show was over, I happened to pass the big doors
of the darkened Civic Auditorium where the circus
had been held. Something woolly and squat, settled
right against the door in waiting, attracted my
attention. I approached and called a name. It
was the mutt.</p>

<p>I petted him and sought to call him away. In
vain. I tried the door. It was unlocked, and I
opened it. We went within, the mutt and myself,
into the great, empty building, where only a
few incandescents gleamed dully to light the path
of the watchman. The crowds were gone. The
dressing rooms were empty. The bandstand was
devoid of brightly clothed musicians. The big sawdust
hippodrome track, as well as the rings and
stages, had disappeared. The circus was gone.</p>

<p>Slowly, as though in wonderment of a changed
world, the mutt made the rounds. He sniffed at
the empty spaces where once the horses had been
quartered. He ran to where Snyder and Toto and
Tillie, the performing elephants, once had swayed
at their ring pins. They were gone. Downstairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
he trotted, but the dressing rooms were empty and
dark. At last, as if convinced, he looked up at me
and whined. I opened the door. A moment of
hesitation, then slowly, wobbling grudgingly upon
those stubby little legs, he trotted away, farther and
farther, at last to fade into the shadows. His day
of glory was done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MENAGERIE “PSYCH-STUFF”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A CIRCUS is a great place for natural development.
There’s not much “book
learnin’,” it’s true; but practicability is a
thing which is understood to the last degree. The
sideshow talker may slaughter the English language,
but he practices more active psychology than
the professor who lectures upon the subject. The
lot superintendent may not know a monsoon from
a period of barometric depression, but he can tell
hours beforehand whether the performance will be
held in fair weather or foul. The boss hostler
never saw the interior of a veterinary school, yet
circus horses, despite their hardships, are healthier,
better cared for and sleeker than the usual occupants
of a riding school. So it goes throughout
the whole establishment, up to and including the
trained animal department. In this latter are
to be found some of the strangest developments
of all.</p>

<p>Perhaps, at some time or another, perched high
upon the reserves, you’ve seen the animal acts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
wondered a bit about them: why certain beasts are
selected for certain tricks and why others are not
used at all. Or perhaps the thought never entered
your head; so far as you were concerned, all animals
were alike.</p>

<p>But to the man down in the steel arena, it has
been a different story. Everything—conforming
to the rule of the circus—must have its reason.
The tiger which rides about the big cage on the
back of an elephant may be the best of its kind,
leaping through flaming hoops without the slightest
concern, but utterly worthless in a simple
“group number” where it may have but a single
duty during the whole act. In the first place, that
tiger may have a single-track mind, such as many
persons have, capable of assimilating only a certain
routine. And on the other hand, it may be a hardened
criminal, with a murder lust so highly developed
that its very presence in a den with other
animals would mean a fight to the death. Or
again, it may be mentally unbalanced, or still worse,
an outcast from the society of its kind and destined
to extermination the minute it seeks the presence of
other tigers. All these things count in the menagerie
of the circus of to-day; things are a bit
different from the olden times, when an animal was
only an animal.</p>

<p>In fact, within the last twenty years, there has
been a complete turnover in the animal business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Methods of training have changed from ones of
undoubted cruelty to those in which the beasts work
for a reward, just as a man or woman works for
a living. Greatest of all, there has been a change
to a system where the beauty or grace of a beast
is placed secondary to the condition of its mentality.
No longer is an animal selected simply because it is
a “good looker.” There is something far more
important,—the brain.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I roamed into the menagerie of
a Mid-Western circus to find Bob McPherson, the
cat trainer, sitting in front of a den containing
four Sumatran tigers. Apparently he was merely
resting there, a newspaper in his hands, reading
awhile, then watching the tigers. The next day it
was the same and the next after that. Then I
asked questions.</p>

<p>“New cats,” answered the trainer in his jerky
fashion. “Just in from Hamburg. Got to break
two of ’em on the road—short in the big act. So
I thought I’d put ’em through their sprouts first
and pick ’em out so I wouldn’t get any more scars
on me. Got four hundred and eighty-eight now.
That’s enough. Don’t want any more. Breaking
cats on the road’s dangerous work, unless you’re
pretty sure of ’em. Just about got ’em picked out.
Guess it’ll be that littlest male and the big female.
Those other two—don’t like ’em. One of ’em
batty and the other one’s a dunce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>For Bob McPherson had been doing something
more than merely sitting there in front of the
tiger den and idly watching a set of cats when he
wasn’t busy with his newspaper. He had been applying
a set of mental tests to his prospective
students, crude perhaps in comparison, yet fully as
efficient for his purpose as the Binet test by which
the human mind is catalogued.</p>

<p>One tiger had been eliminated from the beginning
and in a glance. He was cross-eyed, which to
the ordinary person would mean nothing.</p>

<p>But the trainer who takes a cross-eyed tiger into
the arena with him also takes the chance of being
carried out a huddled, bleeding mass, in a piece of
canvas. Crossed eyes in a human mean little.
Crossed eyes in a tiger mean that somewhere in the
past there has been misbreeding; that a brother and
sister or father and daughter have mated, bringing
into the world a thing that is warped in intelligence,
lacking in mental poise and balance, and with a predilection
toward murder. And so the cross-eyed
Sumatran had been passed by without further
examination.</p>

<p>As to the others their every action had been
watched by the trainer; the manner in which they
fed, voracity with which they attacked their food,
their actions when the crowds came into the big
tent, their attitude toward the cage boy and toward
his steel scraper when he came to clean the dens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Prince!” called McPherson. The small male,
apparently asleep, opened its eyes, stared calmly
for an instant, then closed them again.</p>

<p>“Janet!” The same thing happened with the
big female.</p>

<p>“Rajah!” The crossed-eyed tiger raised his
head and hissed, his long yellow teeth disclosed
from furling lips.</p>

<p>“Major!” There was no response. The
fourth tiger did not recognize the call; it merely
lay there, eyes closed, dormant. The trainer
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Lunkhead!” he exclaimed. “Doesn’t even
know his own name. If he can’t learn his name,
how is he going to learn tricks?”</p>

<p>By which little experiment had a great deal been
explained. Prince and Janet had shown by their
calm recognition that they not only could understand
the distinct name by which they had been
designated, but that also the voice of the man who
called it brought no malice or enmity. The actions
of Rajah, the inbred, had been of a different
nature; the application of the name had caused
snarling rebellion, indicative of revolt should the
animal ever be taken into the training den. Major—well,
Major was no more than McPherson had
called him; a lunkhead, without even enough brains
to know when he was spoken to. And this kind of
an animal is even more dangerous than the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
which is plainly and openly rebellious against human
control.</p>

<p>In fact, in the menagerie, he occupies the same
position that the “harmless imbecile” does in the
human strata. For years he may amble through
life, allowing the world and all it contains to go
past him. Then suddenly, he goes mad.</p>

<p>An instance of this happened recently with John
Helliott, a trainer for one of the big shows. His
exhibit was short of tigers, and merely to “dress the
act” he took into the arena with the rest of the big
cats an animal which had always been looked upon
as a harmless, amiable dunce. There was little
training; Helliott did not want the Bengal to do
more than merely sit upon its pedestal, a thing
comparatively easy, for the beast apparently was
too lazy to desire to do anything else.</p>

<p>So week after week it went on; the cat came
forth from the chute, stretched itself, then went to
its seat, there to sit vacuously until the act was
over. Then one day, something happened.</p>

<p>It was nothing new. Nothing but what had happened
twice every day during the whole of the
tiger’s term as an actor, a clown “walk around,” in
which one of the circus funsters made the circuit of
the hippodrome track in the guise of a radio fan,
with a contraption upon his head designed to represent
a broadcasting apparatus, from which there
spluttered sparks and the constant crackle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
electricity. It had been going on ever since the
season had started. But the tiger simply hadn’t
noticed it, that was all. On this occasion its vacant
eyes happened to be turned in that direction.
It saw the sparks; it heard the queer crackling
noise, it went crazy with fear. When a frenzied
tent was finally stilled again, they carried John
Helliott forth to four weeks in a hospital, the victim
of a “harmless imbecile.”</p>

<p>That there are imbeciles among animals, that
there are the criminally insane, the criminally
jealous; morons, warped intellects, criminal effects
of laziness; the murder instinct as apart from a
natural instinct of self-preservation, and a deliberate
desire among some beasts to revolt against the
laws of right and wrong are all things which have
become foregone conclusions among the animal
trainers of to-day. Nor are they the result of mere
theories, but rather of experiments in animal psychology
to learn which certain beasts do certain
things, and the cause for rebellion or obedience.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, animal training has become
greatly like human training, especially as regards
right and wrong. In fact, this is the first thing
that is taught the caged beasts, that it is wrong,
for instance, to attempt to steal a cage-mate’s food;
that it is wrong to fight the feeding forks by which
meat is placed within the den, or attempt to tear at
the cage scrapers with which their homes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
cleaned. That paws should remain within the
cage and not outside; in fact, that anything which
happens beyond the bars should be disregarded entirely.
The circus must remember always that it
caters to spectators, and that some of these spectators
apparently leave their brains at home when
they go to a circus lot. They know that a tiger
or a lion or a leopard is a dangerous beast; they
know that their claws are poisonous and sufficiently
strong to tear the muscles loose from a person’s
arm. But nevertheless, if a big cat happens to be
quiescent in its cage, there’ll come the inevitable:</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it pretty? I’m going to see if I can’t
pet it!”</p>

<p>Whereupon there is a sally under the guard ropes—providing
the menagerie attendant isn’t looking—and
an attempt to pet an animal which fears
every human except his trainer. Then, when the
beast inadvertently claws at an arm or a hand, the
visitor becomes angry and blames the circus. Therefore,
there is only one recourse, to make it a part
of animal morals and ethics to keep their paws
within their cages and not offer temptations to misguided
humans.</p>

<p>What is more, the animals of a menagerie seem
to recognize these rules and understand them.
The house-cat instinct to play runs through every
jungle feline. A fluttering piece of canvas outside
the den will offer a constant temptation to paw and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
tear at it; yet I have seen a leopard disregard a
thing like this for hours, seemingly paying no attention
to it, until the meal call comes from the
cookhouse and the menagerie is deserted of attendants.
Whereupon it will sneak forward, play with
the canvas until it notes a returning animal man,
when it will halt and once more drop back into its
usual position, as though that tantalizing bit of
canvas were nothing whatever in its life.</p>

<p>Nor does all this merely happen. It comes
about, according to the present-day animal men,
through a thoroughly developed morality or lack
of it. The animal trainer is these days a person
of constant experiments, of irrepressible inquiry.
It is he who must go into the dens with jungle
beasts, or command the elephants in the rings. If
things go wrong, he is the one who is taken to the
hospital as a result of it, and so he wants to know
the why of every animal’s action. During these
experiments, some surprising things have taken
place, and some revelations concerning the workings
of animal minds and animal criminality.</p>

<p>Several years ago, three young tigers, a male and
two females, all from different mothers, were
placed together in a cage of the John Robinson
Circus as a “baby animal” feature. They played
together, ate together, seemed happy together.</p>

<p>They grew. The male and one female developed
to maturity with a rapidity which was overlooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
by the menagerie men. The second female
remained a cub. Nevertheless the old case of the triangle
had developed; one morning the side boards
of the den were taken down and surprised animal
men stared within. The smallest tiger was dead;
torn and slashed by tooth and claw. The other
tigers were nuzzling each other; purring and growling
in the good humor of matedom. For them the
world was quite rosy; the other angle of the triangle
was gone. What is more, the murder of the
tigress had been accomplished by both of them;
their claws were equally discolored; their jowls both
reddened where teeth had torn at the throat and
spine of an interloper.</p>

<p>This does not happen solely with what might be
called the lower forms of jungle animals. Quite
otherwise, it is more apparent in the primates. In
the Stuhr Menagerie at Portland, for instance, were
three orang-outangs, a male and two females. For
a time everything was lovely; then the male chose
a mate from the pair with which he was quartered,
and the ancient story of one woman too many began
again.</p>

<p>The fortunate Mrs. Orang-outang seemed to
make no objection to the company of her lady
friend. But the male did. Morning, night and
noon he beat her, bit her, spat and snarled at her,
stole her food from her and in general abused her
in a manner wholly unbecoming a gentleman. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
which she offered no objection, for the simple reason
that she was in love with him.</p>

<p>So much, in fact, that when the menagerie men
decided upon separation as a surcease to her sorrows,
she threw herself against the bars, squealed and
cried and lamented; and finally decided upon starvation
as a means of suicide rather than to be separated
from the rest of the family. The animal men
decided to put her back again. But as rapidly
they decided otherwise. This time there was no
forbearance. Both set upon her, the male taking
the initiative, and it was only by main force that
she was rescued, torn and bleeding, to be sold immediately
in an effort to save her from herself.</p>

<p>Nor is it always elemental, this strain of law-breaking
in the menagerie. Nor is every overt act
classed as criminal. Recently with one of the big
shows, it was noticed that a riding tiger, each day
when it finished its ride around the arena upon the
back of a horse, and leaped to the ground, struck out
farther and farther toward the trainer. At last
came the time when the beast reached the ground
almost at the feet of the animal man, suddenly to
straighten, to hiss, then to strike savagely at him
with both forefeet. The blows were avoided, the
animal sent back to its pedestal, and after the performance
there were conferences. Several of them.
Either that tiger had worked out a carefully conceived
plot, deliberately carried forward day by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
day, or some more natural cause was responsible
for the attack.</p>

<p>The idea of a plot didn’t seem reasonable; animals
do strange things, it is true; but rarely are
their actions more than the result of a natural cunning,
which leads them to simulate docility in order
to gain their ends. The belief that this tiger could
have worked out a theory by which it could approach
an inch or so nearer each day was a bit too heavy
even for menagerie men; so they looked for something
else and found it. The cause of that attack
had been a rapidly growing affection of the eyes
which had caused the tiger progressively to misgauge
his distance when leaping. Then, at last,
the surprise of finding his trainer right upon him
had caused the attack. They sent for the circus
veterinary, treated the tiger’s eyes, forgave him
his trespasses, and now, with his vision clear again,
he’s back in the steel arena once more.</p>

<p>Every now and then, in truth, there’s a Freudian
aspect about the handling of menagerie beasts, complicated
until the cause becomes known, and afterward
extremely simple. As was the case of Jake,
a full-bred Nubian lion, trained to the “Wallace”
or untamable lion trick, and one of the most faithful
beasts of his kind in captivity.</p>

<p>Jake’s task in life was to nearly kill his trainer
twice daily, in what is known as the “Wallace stunt.”
An act, by the way, which demands exactness on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
part of the trainer and of the beast, a perfect understanding
between the two, and a high order of intelligence
on the part of the animal, for the simple
reason that his job is to fool the audience.</p>

<p>The lion is let into the arena, roaring and bellowing
the minute he leaves his cage. He chews at
his pedestal. He turns and claws and thunders at
the attendants outside. To all intents and purposes,
he is a raging, vengeful thing that really
doesn’t begin to get along with himself until he’s
killed a trainer or two a day. He seeks to climb
the bars of the big den; he claws at the netting;
from outside the trainer throws him a crumpled
piece of cloth and he tears it to shreds even before
it has had time to strike the arena floor. Meanwhile
the audience shivers and shakes, hoping the
trainer won’t try to go in there, and then hoping
that he will, inasmuch as they’ve never really seen
a trainer killed. Then the trainer opens the door
and leaps within. The battle is on!</p>

<p>Revolvers flash, whips crack. But the lion will
not be tamed. Gradually he forces the trainer
backwards, closer, closer; now he has him in a corner
and crouches to leap; now the trainer edges
forth into a new chance for life, only to be re-cornered
by the bloodthirsty beast; to be almost
chewed to pieces, and finally, in a desperate rush,
he escapes through the steel door just as the lion
comes crashing against it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Thrilling! But only an act, after all. For
every movement of that battle is a rehearsed thing,
with the lion and the trainer each knowing every
instant what the other is going to do. And the
lion which displays his fierceness in this manner is
usually the calmest beast of the whole menagerie.
So it was with Jake. Until one day they changed
his habitat from a full cage to one slightly smaller
than a half compartment. And that day Jake became
a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!</p>

<p>In the arena, he was the same old Jake, dependable,
exact to the quarter of an inch. But once the
act was over and he was returned to his new home,
he became in reality the beast he had simulated in
the steel arena.</p>

<p>Apparently there was no cause for it. Nevertheless
the consequence was there. Instead of his
usual amiability, he had taken on a sullen, vengeful
fierceness. His trainer could not come near him.
He fought the feeding forks. He refused food.</p>

<p>They tried experiments upon him to test his
mentality and to seek to determine the extent
of his murder lust. A live cat was placed scrambling
in the den. He paid no attention to it. A
fluttering chicken was thrown within. He disregarded
that also. His hate was for humans and
humans alone, the humans who had placed him in
that small enclosure; and his hatred vanished as
soon as he was released into the steel arena. About<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
that time they began to inquire into Jake’s past.</p>

<p>That inquiry brought forth the fact that Jake had
been shipped to America five years before; that he
had come in a crate too small for him, and that he
had been horribly mistreated by one of the attendants
who accompanied him to this country from
the shipping headquarters in Europe. Perhaps
Jake didn’t remember the specific instance. But
the closeness of small quarters had brought back
to him an instinctive hatred, and Jake was a murderer
as long as that instinct worked on him. The
result was that Jake was returned to his old domicile,
a full cage, and he once more became placid.
Even I, no trainer of lions, or even of dogs, could
go into the cage with him and not think any more
of it than a visit with a house cat. But in that
small cage, well that was something else again!</p>

<p>So it goes. Mentality’s a queer thing, even in
beasts. The amount of insanity which has been
discovered in recent years has been surprising, even
to men who had argued its presence. Nor is there
much deviation between the human and animal
cause.</p>

<p>A great part of it comes from inbreeding and
poor parentage, just as it does with humans. Some
comes from illness, especially that affecting the spine
and nerves. And still another cause is idleness.</p>

<p>Evidently Adam wasn’t the only being that was
told to get out and earn his daily food. Animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
must have received their orders also, for the happiness
and health and mental comfort of every one
of them depends upon work. Lions and tigers and
leopards are made to pace in expectancy for their
meals; the great hunks of meat are purposely
delayed. The elephant is happiest when he is
worked hard, and plenty of strain placed upon his
muscles. The tamest beasts of any circus are the
“working bulls,” allowed to wander at will about
the circus grounds, with their trainer lolling in the
shadow of a wagon and commanding his charge
merely by a word or a grunt. And nowadays the
first thing that is prescribed for a convalescent beast
on at least one circus is exercise!</p>

<p>It came about in a rather queer way. A three-year-old
lioness became ill with an intestinal
disease. Weakened, it was believed that absolute
rest was the best thing for her. She was taken out
of the act of which she formed a part, confined in
a half compartment, and presumably well cared
for. Months went by. Then it was discovered
that the cat had become insane.</p>

<p>Her breeding, slightly inbred, was a part of the
cause, it was true. But another was enforced idleness.
The symptoms took the form of a constant
scratching against the floor of the cage, not noticed
until the animal had worn the pads of her paws
bare, and, in a sudden excess of agony, had rolled
to her back, as if, by holding the bleeding paws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
aloft, to cool and soothe them. The menagerie
superintendent went close to the cage and for a
long time studied the beast, her nervous twitchings,
the spasmodic reversion to that frenzied digging
and scratching, then the return to the position on
her back, the pain-ridden paws stretched above her.</p>

<p>“Only one thing to do,” came the conclusion, and
the menagerie superintendent hurried for the
harness-maker’s tent.</p>

<p>There he fashioned a set of four shoes, built
much after the fashion that shoes for dogs are
made. Following which he obtained assistance,
bound the beast, carefully bandaged the ragged
paws, affixed the shoes and released the big cat.</p>

<p>There was a moment or so of ludicrous skating
about, an exaggerated edition of a house cat in
paper shoes, then the lioness attacked the trappings
with her teeth, tore them off, and resumed her
former activities. The menagerie superintendent
only sighed and went back to the harness shop.</p>

<p>This time, when he did his cobbling, he inserted
sharp tacks, protruding from the inside. Patiently
he put the new set of footgear on the lioness and
awaited results. Once more she strove to tear
them off, but the tacks hurt her mouth. She desisted,
and tried again, for the third and fourth
and fifth time. During which periods, the insane
desire to scratch overcame her. For moments at
a time she would forget that the raw-fleshed paws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
were padded, only to return to her gnawing, and to
desist. At last, she ceased to fight the pads, and
the superintendent gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Now let her scratch to her heart’s content,” he
announced. “The more the merrier.”</p>

<p>In the next three weeks the lioness wore out six
pairs of shoes. In the meantime she began to round
out; her eyes became clearer, and the frenzies of
scratching less pronounced. In a month the paws
had healed and a seventh pair of shoes was placed
on her feet, to last far longer than the others.
Gradually the big cat became saner, more natural.
At last the scratching ceased entirely; the shoes
were removed, and the menagerie superintendent
gave a verdict of returned sanity. Exercise, which
might otherwise have killed the beast, through infection
of those torn paws, had effected a cure,
through a set of leather shoes. And to-day that
lioness is back in her act, clear and strong again.
After all, there’s more to the care of menagerie
animals than merely feeding them!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE ELLYPHANTS ARE COMING-G-G!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE drizzly, murky day last spring, a heavily
loaded freighter pushed a course
through the fog toward New York, then
brought up clumsily at quarantine. A tug approached
in cocky haste. A man climbed aboard,
searched through the few passengers, found the
person he sought and asked a hurried question.</p>

<p>“How many bulls did you bring over?”</p>

<p>The other, a representative of the Hagenbeck
interests of Germany, wholesale dealers in jungle
animals, grinned.</p>

<p>“Seven. But—”</p>

<p>“I’ll take ’em all!”</p>

<p>“But—you can’t. They’re not for sale.”</p>

<p>“Not for—?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” the animal man grinned again, “they’re
all sold. The Ringling bunch heard somewhere
that I had ’em aboard and they bought ’em by
radio, a thousand miles out at sea!”</p>

<p>Following which there were swear words, expressed
in circus fashion. Elephants, or “bulls,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
as they are known, are becoming scarce. They’re
as protected in India—and India, not Africa, is the
supply point of the circus elephant—as deer in
America. They’re hard to get, and yet they must
be gotten, for the simple reason that they are the
backbone, the sinew, the bones and what-not of the
circus. The menagerie is only a vacant tent without
the pachydermic stake line and its peanut mendicants;
the circus parade is only so much hollow
mockery without that inevitable cry of:</p>

<p>“Hold yo’ hosses, everaybodie-e-e-e-e! The ellyphants
are coming!”</p>

<p>With the result that the notice of a shipment
of elephants is a signal for scurrying about in the
outdoor show world, of hasty summoning of
finances, of notes at the bank if necessary. Circuses
are in the business of knowing what the public—the
mass public, gauged upon a standard of millions
of persons a year—really wants in them.
And what that public desires above everything else
is elephants! This in spite of the fact that this
same public knows less about the big animals than
almost any other beasts in the menagerie, notwithstanding
that element of personal association via
the bag of peanuts and the daily visiting in front of
the picket line before the announcers begin their
bawling warnings that the “beeg show, the be-e-g
show,” is about to begin!</p>

<p>Nor is the public alone in its affection. Back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of the public is the circus man himself, with a love
for those same elephants exceeded only by his love
for the “opery,” an affection, incidentally, expressed
in the reverse; you’ll never hear a circus man announce
his affection for “the trick” while the season
is in progress. On the contrary he swears at
it, at the hardships, the weather, the long jumps,
the longer hours, and everything else connected
with the life of his canvas world. In the same
fashion he swears at the elephants, for their prankishness,
for their prowling proclivities, for their
temperamental natures, their appetites, their inclination
to rampage at the slightest provocation,
and for the very fact that they’re elephants. But
nevertheless he’ll fight for them almost as soon as
he’ll fight for the circus itself, because he loves
them, and because he knows them. The reason?
Simply because they’re circus folks themselves in
a different sort of package, even to the extent of
conversation!</p>

<p>A few years ago, a scientist discovered that
monkeys could talk, and thereby believed he had
discovered something new about animals. It created
a great deal of interest, except in the circus.
For why should a showman worry about a little
thing like a monkey, when he can not only listen to
pachyderm’s conversation, but understand it! The
veriest “punk” about a circus menagerie can tell you
without even a glance at the picket line, what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
going on among the elephants, from ordinary contentment
to the preludes of a breakaway!</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is simple to learn that language.
When an elephant desires to make an imperative
demand, it does so by a sharp blast which is used
for that purpose, and that alone. When it begs or
coaxes, the trumpet call is soft and pleading, almost
a whine. When one elephant is frightened and another
isn’t, the calm member soothes the companion
by a soft announcement which carries a low and
expressive note. To say nothing of the love
lullaby—and, an elephant in love is as thorough
about the matter as a sixteen-year-old boy—the fear
signal, the danger signal, the warning chirrup which
inevitably gives the announcement of an impending
stampede; the wailing cry of pain or distress by
which a “bull” tells when he is ill, and lastly,
the sound of gratitude or contentment. When a
pachyderm thumps on the ground with his trunk
to attract your attention, then places the end of
his trunk in his ear, using that ear as a sort of
diaphragm, and blows with the softness of a reed
instrument in the hands of a practiced musician, you
can mark it down for certain that there’s one elephant
in the world that is pleased almost beyond
speech!</p>

<p>So, perhaps it’s because they understand the elephantine
language that circus men like elephants.
Perhaps it isn’t. For the one real reason is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
fact that the bulls can be the most foolish, yet at
the same time, remain fundamentally the most
sagacious beasts of the whole animal kingdom!
This goes for everything, from government on
down. In elephantdom, there are even elections, to
say nothing of a rare case now and then of a
complete change of administration.</p>

<p>The elephant is a strong believer in government,
of the feminine sort. There aren’t any male party
leaders. It’s the female every time which forms
the head of an elephant herd and which handles the
reins of administration. But one queen can be better
than another, and the subjects are quick to
recognize the fact!</p>

<p>In 1903, a Western circus, which at that time possessed
an elephant herd of six members, ruled by a
comparatively young and inexperienced queen, decided
that it needed more pachyderms. It therefore
sent to Germany for two additions to the herd,
with the result that a month or so later there arrived
in America a determined feminine named Old
Mom, accompanied by her equally feminine sidekick,
Frieda.</p>

<p>Mom and Frieda had been boss and assistant
boss of a herd in Germany. A wise old bull was
Mom. Sixty years of age, slightly puffy under the
eyes—elephants have a strange way of showing
their years, in much the same manner as a human—with
a few teeth missing, but with a bump of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
sagacity and determination which had made her outstanding
even among a group of thirty elephants in
Germany, old Mom was a sort of Queen Victoria
among pachyderms. A strong friendship between
the owners of the animal farm in Germany and the
owner of the circus had been responsible for her
shipment, friendship which the circus owner looked
upon as a bit left-handed as he read the letter which
announced her coming.</p>

<p>“Fine bunch Hagenbeck’s handed me!” came
dolefully. “He’s sent over a bull that’s used to
running things in the herd. I’ve already got a
leader. What’ll happen when they get together?
Fight their heads off, I guess.”</p>

<p>Nor were the bull-men quite sure themselves
what the outcome would be; it was about the same
proposition as a general manager being hired for a
factory where the only executive position was already
filled. With some misgivings, they led Mom
and her friend Frieda into the menagerie tent and
put them with the herd. Nothing happened. A
few days went by, in which Bumps, the regular
leader, continued at her job as the mainspring of
the herd, Mom and her chum, Frieda, merely tagging
along and doing what the rest did. Then
something happened!</p>

<p>There wasn’t a revolution; in fact, it just seemed
to happen. In the herd was a young elephant
which was being trained and which didn’t like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
procedure. On the third day after Mom’s arrival,
the bull-keeper placed his hook gently behind the
student’s ear to lead him forth to his lessons. The
elephant protested, squealing as though in pain, as
though the keeper were using cruelty and really
plunging the hook deep in his flesh. Old Mom
watched the proceeding with interest.</p>

<p>More, when that scholar came back to his place
in line, still squealing the distress signal, Old
Mom walked over to him, eyed him carefully,
reached forth her trunk and very tenderly examined
the skin behind the ear, as though searching for
some evidence of a wound. She didn’t find it; the
elephant had lied about that bull-hook. Immediately
Old Mom gave her verdict, by tightly coiling
her trunk, then sending it forth with the force of
a pile driver, striking the malingerer squarely in
the forehead and flooring him. After which she
calmly walked back to her stake.</p>

<p>Immediately the picket line became a thing of
low-voiced chirrups, of excited trumpeting and of
general chatter, so complicated that even the animal
men didn’t know what it was all about. But
they found out the next morning.</p>

<p>It was dawn, and a long haul from the circus
train to the lot. The twenty-four-hour man, standing
in the middle of the road, flagged down the
cookhouse wagon and shouted a message:</p>

<p>“Let the bulls go first. Two or three bridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
that don’t look any too safe. Better wait ’till the
elephants have tested ’em.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the announcement traveled on down
the line to the elephant superintendent, and a moment
later he passed on the run, his gigantic charges
trundling after. They reached the first bridge.</p>

<p>“Bumps!” he shouted. But Bumps hung back.
Instead, in her place, as calmly as though she had
occupied the position all her life, Old Mom walked
forward, followed by Frieda, placed one foot on
the bridge, hefted her weight to it, pronounced it
safe, and crossed, her handmaiden close beside her,
and Bumps taking third place in line. It had been
accomplished overnight. The herd had found the
kind of a leader it wanted—and elected her. Old
Mom has been in command ever since!</p>

<p>Nor was ever a political boss more autocratic.
Like many another leader of elephant herds, Old
Mom has her system, which runs from rewards to
punishments, from “beating up” the male members
or agitators to soothing the feelings of some
squealing “punk,” fresh from its fright of the first
lesson in elephant training. Never does Old Mom
neglect to check up on the effects of the first few
days at school. With the sensitive “finger” of her
trunk working with the exactness of a measuring
tape, she covers, inch by inch, the spots where the
ropes have been tied to trip the animal in the process
of teaching it to lay down, examines the spots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
behind the ears and along the trunk where the elephant
men are wont to catch the beast with their
elephant hooks, looking everywhere for evidences
of rope burns or cruelty. If she finds them, there
is bellowing and hatred for an inefficient animal
trainer, often leading to investigation by the animal
superintendent and the discharge of the offending
trainer. If she doesn’t, which is usually the case,
she merely cajoles the beast with slow-sounding,
reed-like noises, gradually calming it. And if the
animal persists in its foolish fears, she whacks it
across the face with her trunk and walks away in
disgust. The queer thing is that she is able to discern
between real and bogus fright; she seems to
know that her charges are naturally lazy and that
they’ll get out of work if they can! More than
once Old Mom has been known to halt in her labors
on the show-lot that she might eye carefully the
elephant which is working with her, or pretending
to work. The best little trick that an elephant
knows is to place its head within about an eighth
of an inch of a wagon and pretend to push, while
really not exerting an atom of effort. It often
fools the bull-men. But it doesn’t fool Old Mom.
One whirling blow of that trunk and Mom herself
does the resting.</p>

<p>But her trunk isn’t Mom’s only weapon. There
are nineteen bulls in her herd now, and some of
them are bigger than she. A battle of trunks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
might result in a disheveled queen. So Mom has
other and more judicious methods. One of these
is to seize the ear of an offender with a quick thrust
of her trunk, cramp it hard, then twist. It never
has failed yet to produce a bellowing, howling subject,
suddenly brought to his knees and begging for
mercy. Another gentle trick is to whirl suddenly,
lower her head and with all her strength, butt a
criminal in the midriff.</p>

<p>Three years ago, a full-grown male elephant was
purchased from another show where the rules of
the herd leader evidently had been a trifle lax. For
four or five days the new member gave evidences of
resenting the stern rule of Old Mom. Then suddenly
everything changed. He was the meekest
member of the whole herd. All his bluster and rebellion
had vanished. Also three inches of his tail.
Old Mom had made one swirling dive, caught his
caudal appendage between her teeth and clamped
hard, while fourteen thousand pounds of elephant
flesh trumpeted and bellowed and squealed, and
while the whole menagerie force struggled to break
the hold. When it all was over, an operation was
necessary to remove the crushed cartilage and bone.
One of Old Mom’s very best boys now is a bob-tailed
elephant!</p>

<p>As for punishment for herself, she recognizes
but one superior, the superintendent of the herd.
To him and him alone she acknowledges the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
of punishment; even makes ready for it. In 1914,
one of the stars of the shows was William Frederick
Cody (Buffalo Bill), and in his employ was a
former officer of the Russian Army who, through
the nonchalance of the circus, had become simply
Rattlesnake Bill.</p>

<p>Rattlesnake Bill teased Old Mom, and the elephant
hated him so much that it became almost
an obsession with her to “get” him. This she attempted
at every opportunity, chasing him when
she saw the chance, striving to sneak up on him—she
could release any chain tie ever made by human
hands—and once almost catching him, and, failing,
taking out her vengeance on Colonel Cody’s spider
trap which Rattlesnake Bill drove, wrecking it.
Then suddenly she halted at the sight of the
superintendent.</p>

<p>A bull-hook lay on the ground. She reached for
it, raised it and extended it to her keeper, offering
it to him that he might punish her. But before he
could raise his arm, she had begun to “talk,”
chirruping in his ear, curling her trunk around his
neck, cooing at him with that peculiar blandishing
tone which, in its very softness, seems impossible
for an elephant; then finally, whimpering, she went
to her knees. If ever an elephant talked herself
out of a well-deserved whack across the trunk, it
was Old Mom, with the result that she returned to
her place at the stake line victorious, while an order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
went forth that Rattlesnake Bill, in the future,
must leave the elephants alone!</p>

<p>In fact, it is such evidences of reasoning power
and of quick thinking that make the elephant such
a beloved thing to the circus man.</p>

<p>“Want to see the slickest thing in the world?”
a bull-tender asked me last spring, as I wandered
into the menagerie tent of a big circus. “Lookit
here!”</p>

<p>He moved proudly to the stake line and opened
the lips of a female elephant. There, crammed
tightly against a ragged, broken tusk, was a close-packed
piece of rag, so held that it prevented the
jagged ivory from cutting the tender membrane of
the mouth.</p>

<p>“Thought that up herself!” the bull-tender went
on. “You know, Lady—that’s her name—she’s
got bum tushes. They keep bustin’ off, and I ain’t
found any way to harden ’em. Sawed ’em off an’
everything, but they just keep bustin’ and gettin’
ragged. They cut her cheek. Couple of months
ago, I see her pick up a rag and jam it in her mouth,
and then she sticks her trunk in her ear and squeals
like she was Columbus discoverin’ America. Ever
since then, I’ve had to have a rag for her. She
does the packin’ herself!”</p>

<p>Nor did the elephant man tell the whole story!
When feeding time came, and there was danger of
swallowing the rag, the elephant carefully extracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
it, laid it aside, proceeded with her meal and, that
finished, reached again for her dental packing and
placed it in its position of protection!</p>

<p>This has its counterpart in the actions of the
herd of another circus, which suddenly appeared on
the streets of a Canadian town, each waving a
gunny sack in very stolid and dignified fashion, as
it marched along in parade. The crowds in the
street didn’t know what it was all about, nor did
a good part of the show, for that matter. Behind
it was a theft, a fight, the hint of an elephant
insurrection, and a great invention. Archimedes
accomplished no more when he discovered the principle
of the screw!</p>

<p>It was fly time—and hard ground. There was
little dust for the bulls to curl into their trunks
and throw on their backs, thus ridding themselves
of the pests. The herd was becoming fidgety when
Old Mom, the leader, noticed something before
her, eyed it in thoughtful mien, then reached forth
her trunk to seize it. A gunny sack.</p>

<p>She waved it on the right side, and the flies departed.
She tried the other side, then straight
over her head. Her back was free! Old Mom
shimmied with delight, then draping the gunny sack
over one ear, she poked her trunk into the other,
to announce a squeal of discovery and of happiness.
But while she was doing this, the next elephant in
line stole the sack!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Immediately there was trouble. The flies had
returned, and Old Mom wanted her sack. But the
thief pretended not to notice. Whereupon Old
Mom whanged him on the proboscis.</p>

<p>He dropped the sack. But before Old Mom
could retrieve it, the third elephant borrowed
the fly duster, and when excited animal punks returned
with the elephant superintendent, four fights
were in progress, while the sack was traveling here
and there about the stake line like a football.
There was a quick command, then peace. Every
elephant was equipped with his own personal fly-swatter,
and what is more, they were retained, each
being carefully carried to the cars at night when
the great, shadowy herd thumped through the semidarkness
for its journey to the next town.</p>

<p>Impossible? That an elephant should think of
such things? Talk for a while with a circus man
who really knows elephants and you’ll find it is
only the beginning!</p>

<p>A number of years ago, one of the big shows was
making the run from Everett, Washington, to
Vancouver, British Columbia, when a wheel broke
on the elephant car, sending the big conveyance
from the tracks and partly capsizing it at a point
just above the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Six of
the elephants broke their chains and liberated themselves
through the smashed roof of the car, but
the seventh was imprisoned, secured by an unusually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
heavy chain and further hampered by a timber
which had penetrated a leg.</p>

<p>The car was barely balanced and threatening
with every plunge of the frightened beast within
to slide into the waters of the sound. When human
aid reached the overturned car, an animal
wrecking crew was already at its labors!</p>

<p>Five of the escaped beasts, with much trumpeting
and tugging, were pulling away the timbers from the
top of the disabled car, and seeking to reach the
timbers which held the imprisoned elephant a captive,
while the sixth bull was banked half beneath
the car and half against it, using a great rock for
a toe-hold, to keep the conveyance from going into
the waters of the Pacific Ocean! When the disabled
animal finally was chopped loose and liberated, the
great splinter of wood removed and the wound
dressed, solicitous members of the herd surrounded
him, examined his wounds with their trunks,
“talked” and trumpeted.</p>

<p>Then, in true elephantine fashion, it struck the
whole herd that there had been a catastrophe and
that they should be terribly frightened, in spite of
the fact that more than an hour had elapsed since
the wreck. Wide went their ears, high their
trunks. Their eyes rolled, and there sounded the
chirrup of a panic. Then away they went, for a
half-mile or so up the tracks, finally to be corralled
and held quiet on a wide stretch of beach until a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
new car could be sent for them. It seems elephant
nature to become far more excited about a thing
after it is over than while it is in progress. The
reasoning process functions until there’s no more
need for it. For which, at least one show is
grateful.</p>

<p>The circus strikes for the South in the autumn,
following as long as it can the lanes of warm
weather, and trailing along in the wake of the
cotton-picking season, gathering up the dollars
which have been distributed as a result of the harvesting
of the crop. So it happened that in late
October, six years ago, a big show was “dipping
through Texas,” showing for that day near a fair
ground where a cotton pageant was in progress and
where one of the attractions was an airplane flight
over the grounds, accompanied by a rather straggling
exhibition of fireworks.</p>

<p>It was six o’clock and already dark. On the
circus grounds, the chandelier man passed on his
rounds and put the spluttering lights in places. The
menagerie was deserted of humans; every one, from
the superintendent down, was on the lot, mingling
with the few townspeople and staring up at the
aerial fireworks. But suddenly a man whirled.
His arms waved. A shout came barking forth:</p>

<p>“Into the menagerie, everybody! Something
wrong!”</p>

</figure>

<p>From within the tent had come the high-toned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
almost shrieking blast of an elephant, the distress
signal, as plain a warning of danger as though it
had been shouted by a human. Men raced through
the entrance and ducked under the side walling—just
in time! One of the chandeliers had flooded,
the burning gasoline running down upon the tinder-dry
grass; already the blaze had spread to piles of
canvas, bales of straw about the animal cages, and
the elephant hay supply. Another minute and the
menagerie would have been a seething mass of
flame, but owing to the elephant’s warning, there
now was a chance.</p>

<p>There was no time to carry water. In the center
of the tent was the inevitable “juice joint,” ready for
the trade of the night and supplied with four barrels
of lemonade. A swift command and men seized
gunny sacks, soaked them in the lemonade barrels
and rushed to the fighting of the fire, while bawling
messengers summoned the rest of the circus crew
and brought the water wagon, followed by crews
equipped with picks and shovels and spades, that
dirt might be used to extinguish the gasoline flames.
Through it all, the elephants remained passive.
But once the danger was past, the leader of the
herd suddenly came to herself, let out a chirrup
and led the herd through the side walling! Which
hardly brought even a growl from the menagerie
crew. They were too grateful for that warning
which had saved the show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>In fact there are many instances where the
elephants have done much to allow a circus to make
good on its promises.</p>

<p>A show which I happened to be visiting was running
from Regina, Saskatchewan, in the prairie country,
to Saskatoon, when a brake beam dropped, and
four flat cars went careening forth upon a railless
journey into the free and open country, though not
overturning.</p>

<p>The train was stalled, with a great part of its
parade and menagerie equipment off the rails, and
with the nearest division point twenty miles away.
Out at the telegraph wires, the conductor “connected
up,” that he might send an announcement
of the wreck to the division superintendent, together
with the request for a wrecking crew to put
the show train back on the rails again. Which
wasn’t even noticed by the circus itself. Instead,
the train boss called for the keeper of the elephants.</p>

<p>“Never get on the lot to-day if we wait for that
wrecker,” he announced. “How about puttin’
them bulls on the job?”</p>

<p>With the result that “them bulls” were put. An
hour later, that portion of the train which had remained
on the rails had been pulled out of the way,
two cars at a time, ties had been placed for a skidway,
the four flat cars had been restored to the
tracks, and the circus was rushing onward to keep
faith with its promises, arriving at its show stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
before the wrecking crew and the “big hook” had
even been able to leave the division point!</p>

<p>Incidentally, there is one thing about an elephant
regarding which there is no uncertainty. He puts
everything he possesses into everything he does,
except work. And the greatest of this wholeheartedness
comes in his likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>There is woe upon a big circus when two elephants,
for instance, decide that they want to be
chums. When that decision happens, neither fire,
flood, pestilence nor disaster can keep them apart.
They will accompany each other when there
is work to be done, or there won’t be any work.
They will break locks, pull up stakes, untie chain
hitches and half-hitches, wreck elephant cars, anything
to be near the particular elephant which they
have selected as a comrade. Nor is this a mating
instinct. It happens more often between female
and female and between male and male than otherwise.
But when it comes along, there’s no doubt
as to whether an elephant has a will of its own!</p>

<p>In a circus which plays the Pacific coast, Gladys
and May decided that they just must be chums.
Being separated by the whole length of the bull
line simply broke their girlish hearts. They had
the urge as strongly as those strange pairs you’ve
sometimes seen in human life, wearing the same cut
and pattern of clothing, the same kind of hat, the
same sort of shoes, and walking eternally with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
arms about each other. The bull-men decided, just
to be obstinate, that Gladys and May could get
along very well as they were, and when they discovered
that Gladys one day had untied her chain
and wobbled over to her girl friend, they promptly
took her back, wrapped her chain around the stake
again and then secured it with a clevis pin, which
worked with a bolt and nut attachment. Then they
left her, to go about their labors of the day.</p>

<p>Gladys remained at her stake until the menagerie
crew went to the evening meal in the cookhouse.
When the menagerie superintendent returned, however,
it was to find Gladys down at the end of the
stake line again, talking over things with her friend,
May. What was more, that clevis pin was
missing!</p>

<p>They searched everywhere, but they could not
find it. Evidently, by diligent work with the
strong, but sensitive “finger” of her trunk, Gladys
had unbolted the pin and then hidden it. But
where? They searched the straw. It wasn’t
there. They went outside the tent. No clevis pin.
Three days later, it was discovered in the straw of
the bull car, Gladys had hidden it in the pouch of
her under-lip, next to the jaw, carried it there all
during the evening and then taken it with her to the
bull car, where she had secreted it in a place which
she believed safe from the prying eyes of circus
men. An elephant doesn’t remain at its stake because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
it feels itself a prisoner. There is hardly an
elephant in America that is not a pachydermic
Houdini. Hitches, half-hitches, square knots, slip-nooses,
single and double ties, all are the same when
one of the big mammals decides that it’s tired of
being attached to a stake. With the result that
when an elephant takes the notion that its life isn’t
complete without the company of another pachyderm,
it generally wins out, or causes trouble.</p>

<p>On another show one year, this chummy instinct
became rampant, the worst of it all being
the fact that the elephants had picked out as their
pals beasts which worked in opposite rings during
the circus performance. The result was that when
the big animals were led into the arena, a scramble
inevitably resulted, with elephants squalling and
trumpeting and squealing in protest, then, becoming
rebellious, chasing half across the tent to get into
the ring which their chums occupied, until at last it
was necessary to make a recasting of the whole herd
so that the “friends” might be together. But in
the circus, even irritable conditions sometimes become
useful. Which brings up again the case of
Mom and her friend Frieda—and a toothache.</p>

<p>If there were such things as false teeth for elephants,
Mom probably would have had them.
Nature fitted her with a poor dental display, and
around the menagerie in which she is the herd-head
the attendants are almost constantly dosing her for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
anything from sore gums to cavities. There came
a time when Mom produced a tooth which needed
pulling.</p>

<p>It caused a conference. The superintendent
knew that he couldn’t rummage around in her
mouth with a pair of forceps and yank out that
tooth with a block and tackle. Besides, there was
no way to chain her sufficiently for a slow, pulling
process. In addition, animal men, propagandists
to the contrary, are as a rule soft-hearted.</p>

<p>So, the task with Mom was to get that tooth out
as quickly as possible, and with a minimum of pain.
The elephant superintendent drove a stake deep
into the ground before Mom, sent her to her
haunches, and then, as tenderly as possible, fastened
one end of a piece of baling wire to the tooth and
the other to the stake. Whereupon he walked
away, picked up his bull-hook, deliberately approached
Frieda and whacked her on the trunk.</p>

<p>Frieda squealed as though her life were in danger,
and Mom jerked to her feet, bellowed, stared
in goggle-eyed fashion, then, suddenly forgetful of
the animal she had sought to succor, jammed her
trunk into her mouth, felt about carefully, and
squealed happily. The tooth lay on the ground,
where it had been yanked by the baling wire as
Mom jumped to her feet! It was the old story
over again, of the boy and a piece of twine tied
to the door knob. Human remedies work with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
elephants also, even to the extent of paregoric when
they get the colic.</p>

<p>And human prejudices, for that matter. You’ve
seen, perhaps, the man who will take a drink himself,
but who abhors drunkenness? The same
thing has been found among elephants, and in at
least one case, it has ended in tragedy. Again it
was Old Mom, and the place was a Pacific coast
metropolis.</p>

<p>Old Mom is a toper. She loves a drink better
than anything else in the world, except candy or
peanuts. Whisky is excellent, beer better, and she
had been known—in other days—to drink five gallons
of cheap wine without losing her dignity. But
she loathes intoxication; in fact, only one of her
keepers ever was able to approach her in an intoxicated
state, and he, simply to show that the
rule was breakable, inevitably slept off his drunkenness
beneath her, while Old Mom would weave
all night in protective wakefulness. Perhaps a
genuine affection might be held responsible for this;
the other case was one of simple acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>A canvasman about the show had been in the
habit of giving Mom a bit of a nip now and then,
and because she enjoyed it and watched for him,
believed that he had found the absolute way to her
heart. On the day of the tragedy, he arrived at
the circus grounds drunk, and at once hurried for
the picket line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Here, Mom,” and he reached for a bottle in
his hip pocket, “come on an’ have drinksh with
me!”</p>

<p>To his surprise, Old Mom didn’t curl her trunk
in the usual fashion of delight and wait for him to
pour a half pint down her throat. Instead, she
lowered her head and gently, though forcibly,
pushed him away. The canvasman reeled to her
again.</p>

<p>“Wash matter wi’ you, Mom!”</p>

<p>“Get away from that bull!” It was the warning
of an elephant man. “She’s sore! She’ll sap you
in a minute!”</p>

<p>But the canvasman only laughed, announced that
he knew Old Mom, and persisted. Again she
pushed him away and for a third time, growing more
and more fretful. A low bellow sounded. The
canvasman did not heed the warning. Instead, he
grasped her trunk and strove to raise it that he
might pour the liquor into her mouth. Then it
happened!</p>

<p>A quick thrust of the head, a lightning-like curling
of the trunk, and Old Mom has lashed forth,
striking the man a terrific blow in the pit of the
stomach and knocking him half across the menagerie.
Hurrying bull-tenders reached him and
assisted him to his feet. Then, groaning, he reeled
out of the tent, and rolling himself in a piece of
canvas outside the side wall, complained for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of his injuries, then went to sleep. But Old Mom
was not satisfied.</p>

<p>The day was a breezy one, and the side wall was
continually being raised, giving the elephant intermittent
sights of her tormentor. All that afternoon
she watched him, but gave no evidence of her
anger. Then when the time for the evening meal
came and the menagerie was deserted, she quietly
untied her fastenings, moved ponderously forward,
straight through the side wall, jerked the unfortunate
drunkard from his wrappings of canvas, raised
the dazed man high, then crashed him to the ground,
stamped upon him, and at last, with one great swirl
of her trunk, lashed her unfortunate victim into a
pile of iron tent stakes. After which she returned
to her place in line, calm and apparently
satisfied!</p>

<p>Nor was there seemingly any remorse upon her
part for her action, a condition which saved her
from punishment. According to her way of figuring,
she had been tormented beyond reason, and had
no amends to make. It is only when an elephant is
sorry for what it has done and realizes that it has
committed an infraction of rules that any sort of
punishment is accepted. Then, a scolding by the
boss of the elephant herd and a few blows of a bull-hook,
hardly even comparable to the spanking of a
child, are more efficacious than all the tortures in
the world. I once saw a big elephant start to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
lead a rampage in the Coliseum in Chicago, only
to be halted by the timely arrival of a favorite
keeper.</p>

<p>“Knees!” shouted the attendant, while a crowd
of circus visitors gathered to see the “punishment.”
The elephant obeyed. The bull-keeper shook his
hook.</p>

<p>“Now ain’t you ashamed of yourself!” he began.
“Ain’t you ashamed of yourself! A great big lummix
like you that ain’t got no more sense than to
start a breakaway in a building like this! I’m
offen you for life—yes, sir, offen you! Wouldn’t
have nothin’ more to do with you if it was the last
breath of my life. A great big boob like you! See
this?” He shook the hook again. “I got a notion
to whale the tar outen you! Just what I’ve
got! A great big simp that ain’t got any more
sense’n— Well, what’ve you got to say for
yourself?”</p>

<p>Perhaps, it was the change of tone more than
the words. The elephant raised his trunk and began
to coax and whine, for all the world as though
he were telling his side of the story. For a full
ten minutes it continued, the animal man announcing
his displeasure, the elephant pleading. At the
end he asked:</p>

<p>“Well, do you think you can be good now?”</p>

<p>Up and down, up and down in an excited affirmative
came the answer, as the elephant bobbed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
head, not once, but a dozen times. The attendant
grinned.</p>

<p>“All right then. Go back to your place in line.”</p>

<p>Whereupon a big elephant, head hung low, with
every evidence of shame, with every appearance
of an abashed, punished child, rose and trotted back
to his accustomed spot in the picket line. But had
that elephant gained the idea somewhere that he
had been perfectly right in his actions, the attendant
might be talking yet!</p>

<p>For an elephant wants what he wants when he
wants it, and nothing else will do. What’s more,
he knows what that want is. Seven years ago a
circus sold an elephant to the Salt Lake Zoo. Two
weeks later, there came a telegram:</p>

<p>“Please rush something from the circus. Alice
is lonesome.”</p>

<p>The menagerie superintendent looked about for
the most available thing and found Meat, a female
Chow dog, a canine hanger-on of the menagerie.
He knew that as a rule, elephants do not
like dogs, and that Alice especially possessed an
aversion for them. But he knew also the workings
of animal psychology. Out went the dog by
express, and a year later when the circus passed
through Salt Lake in Liberty Park were two inseparable
friends, whose story was known to
every person in Salt Lake. They had even progressed
to the status of a little act, by which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
amused Sunday visitors, Alice doing the “sit up,”
while the dog balanced herself on the elephant’s
head. Because of the fact that she had saved
a pachyderm from death, caused by loneliness, Meat
was the possessor of a municipally presented collar,
engraved with a perpetual license! While Alice
was beaming with elephantine happiness, content in
the possession of a comrade which she loved, not
because she was a dog, but because Meat typified
a thing where the big animal had been happy, a
place which had stood for home,—the circus!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>A HUNDRED TONS OF PRANKISHNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CONTINUING the subject of elephants, I
remember a pre-season conference last winter
where a circus owner got a new idea.
Around the table were the press representatives,
the general agent, the manager and all the rest of
the men whose constant winter activity forms a part
of the preparations for the summer season of a
circus; posters and various sorts of billing were
scattered about, letters from performers desiring
contracts were piled high in the wicker receiving
baskets, and suggestions were everywhere. So the
circus owner made a suggestion of his own.</p>

<p>“Got a new catch-line for the bulls,” he announced,
as he stared across the room toward a
twenty-four-sheet stand depicting the accomplishments
of the five herds of elephants. “We’ll cut
out this stuff about massive mastodons and ponderous
pachyderms and call ’em what they really
are—a hundred tons of prankishness.”</p>

<p>It was a great idea, for a moment. Then one
by one, press agent, manager, general agent, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
overruled him. Not that it wasn’t the truth. Not
that it wasn’t a good catch-line. But what would
it mean to the man in the street? Nothing. So
another good circus idea went into the waste basket,
the discarding even being approved finally by the
circus owner himself, and all for the reason that
the public wouldn’t know what the show was talking
about. For the most interesting things about
elephants are the things they do when the public
isn’t there to pay to watch them! The performances
in the ring are only the result of so many
lessons. It’s when school is out, or the tremendous
pupil is playing hookey, that the true elephant
nature comes forth, and naturally that seldom
happens during show hours.</p>

<p>No matter what natural science may have to say
about it, an elephant has a dual personality. The
sage is intermittently present, with his nervousness,
his concentration which makes him hysterically
responsive to the slightest untoward happening, and
his deliberate, carefully conceived actions which
show a slow-working but delicately perfect brain
mechanism; while opposed to all this is a school
kid, just crawling out the window of the class-room,
mouth drawn down at one corner, eyes twinkling,
and two fingers wiggling in temptation to his playmates
for a session at “hookey” and a dip in the
old swimmin’ pool. It is this side of the elephant
nature that the ordinary person seldom sees, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the one which the circus doesn’t advertise. For
it comes forth at about the same time that the mischievousness
of the freckled-faced kid makes its
appearance, when nobody’s looking, and when
there’s a hole in the hedge that leads to the watermelon
patch.</p>

<p>Speaking of watermelons, it was in Oklahoma,
and late summer. Night. Out on the show grounds,
a mile or so away, the audience still was
packed uncomfortably upon the “fourteen-highs,”
watching the last half of the performance, while
down in the railroad yards teams were tangled about
the loading runs, the pull-up horses were working
ceaselessly, workmen were shouting and straining,
and the first section was fighting against time for its
get-away, that it might hurry on to the next town,
bearing the parade paraphernalia, the menagerie
tent, tableau wagons, dens, cages, led stock, elephants
and whatever was possible to be taken from
the show-lot without actually affecting the main
performance itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve noticed sometimes, on coming
from the “big top” or main tent of a circus at night,
that things seem strange, and that you reach freedom
from the dense, massing throngs much sooner
than you had believed possible? It is simply
because half the circus has departed while you have
been in the main tent; while the big show has been
in progress, the menagerie, midway, horse tents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
blacksmith shop, cookhouse and practically everything
except the big top itself has been dismantled,
loaded, and already is rushing on toward the next
show stand.</p>

<p>So, on this night, while performers worked in the
big top, the first section crew labored in the carbide-illumined
stretches of the railroad yards, struggling
to save every minute that the first section might
“high-ball out.” The steel runways shrieked protestingly
to their places aboard the flat cars. The
loading was finished, and from the head of the
train to the great, shadowy bulk of the stock and
“bull cars,” far down the tracks, the first section
awaited the orders that would send it jolting and
bumping upon its journey of the night. The conductor
gave a command, a lantern raised, the “high-ball”
whistle piped from the engine, and the train
began slowly to move.</p>

<p>Only to halt at the command of swift-working
emergencies, as quick-winking lanterns flashed in
a hysterical sequence of “wash-out” signals. A
car-knocker had run yelping forth from the depths
of the shadows, his face a conglomeration of pinkish
red, his shoulders damp and his eyes staring.</p>

<p>“Robbers!” he gasped. “Robbers down there
in one of those cars! They hit me on the head!”</p>

<p>“Hit you?” The conductor stared. “What
with?”</p>

<p>“A watermelon! Threw it down at me from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
on top of the car when I bent over to look at the
journals.”</p>

<p>“But—why a watermelon?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it was all they had. Anyway,
it was enough! It knocked me out. There are
robbers on that car, I’m telling you. Heard ’em
moving around. I probably butted into them—discovered
’em. Beating it out of town with a
bunch of swag and I—.”</p>

<p>It was sufficient to hold the train. Almost anything
can hold a circus train when a town decides
there’s the faintest possibility of a thief aboard.
A wild call went out for the town marshal, who
responded from the loading crossing with six hastily
summoned deputies. Then, revolvers drawn,
accompanied by circus men with tent stakes and
“laying-out pins” the marshal started down the dark
lane beside the railroad cars in search of the robber
band.</p>

<p>The posse reached the spot of the assault and
called a command for surrender. There was no
reply, save a queer sound as of tremendous things
skating about inside one of the cars, and a continual
sound of joyous crunching. Again was the
command given, to no purpose. About that time,
some one thought to press the button of a flashlight,
and for a full moment thereafter, the posse
could only stand and gawk.</p>

<p>Within the “bull car” eight elephants were having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the time of their assorted lives. Here and
there they skated and slipped and shambled, sliding
about in a mass of crushed watermelons, their
mouths jammed with the beloved fruit, their heads
and shoulders sticky and wet with the juice, and the
whole floor of the car as slick as a skating pond. A
railroad representative arrived, became pompous,
then made an announcement:</p>

<p>“There’ll have to be an arrest made for this,
can’t have you circus men stealing watermelons from
railroad property—.”</p>

<p>The boss animal man grinned.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Go right ahead and do
your arresting. But it ain’t circus men you’ll be
takin’, it’s elephants.”</p>

<p>As if to prove the assertion, the trunk of the
leader of the herd went forth, between the bars of
the “bull car” and into the recesses of a watermelon
car on the next track, to come forth a second
later with another titbit, which was carried within
the elephant car, thrown to the floor, skated upon
in kittenish fashion by the rest of the herd as it
rushed greedily forward, then devoured. Investigation
showed that one of the elephants evidently
had scented the watermelons in the opposite car,
reached forth, broken the seal, then pushed open
the door, thereupon inviting the rest of the herd to
the feast. Evidently the arrival of the car-knocker
had frightened one of the thieves, causing it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
drop the melon it was purloining just at that instant
on the head of the employee who had reported an
attack by robbers.</p>

<p>In fact, thieving by elephants is a rather common
occurrence. The worst of it is that they cannot be
punished for it. In spite of all the flub-dub that
goes the rounds about the cruelties that are practiced
upon animals, it is next to impossible to punish
an elephant, and then only for some major
offense, such as a deliberate attempt at murder.
With the result that minor infractions can be accompanied
by little more than a scolding, which the
elephant accepts in much the manner of a small
boy: he appears dreadfully downcast, cries and
trumpets, goes to his knees as though to promise
that it never will happen again and then, at the
first opportunity, proceeds to do as he pleases.</p>

<p>A circus with which I once was connected suddenly
hired two private detectives. “Prowlers”
had fastened themselves upon the show, evidently
riding the flat cars at night, and then, when the long
circus train was asleep, raiding the sleeping cars,
stealing everything from pictures to pocketbooks.
In fact, from the indications, the thieves were plain
kleptomaniacs; it seemed to make little difference
what they took, just so they had something to show
for their work of the night.</p>

<p>For a full week the detectives labored diligently,
searching the cars, investigating the personnel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the men who rode the flats at night, even looking
into the “possum bellies” beneath the coaches.
Nothing was discovered. The thieves worked like
wraiths; doors were locked, but they stole just the
same. Then one morning, just before dawn, as
the two sections lay beside each other in the railroad
yards, a performer and his wife suddenly
awakened with the knowledge that their covering
had been yanked from them and whisked through
the open window!</p>

<p>The method of the thieves at last had been discovered.
The nights were hot, the windows of the
coaches were open. Evidently the robber or robbers
worked with a stepladder, climbing up beside
the windows and then pilfering the berths through
the open windows. But when lights had been
obtained, the car porter aroused, and the performers
dressed to proceed with an outside investigation,
the theories suffered a setback. The bull car was
opposite that coach. Whereupon, the elephant
superintendent decided upon a search.</p>

<p>Carefully concealed in the straw bedding of the
big car, the loot was found: a silver-backed hair-brush,
three pocketbooks containing various amounts
of money, two mirrors, a corset, one fringed bed
cover which evidently had just been hidden, the
remains of a man’s straw hat, fifteen photographs
purloined from the decorations of the various
berths, a Titian-hued “switch,” a Palm Beach coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the remains of a bag of candy, four pencils, one shoe
and a collar button! After that, the two sections
were spotted at different places and the mysterious
robberies ceased. That is, as far as the performers
were concerned. But the bull cars remained always
a source of revenue; principally the tops of
milk cans, snatched from trucks as the circus trains
passed through the various stations.</p>

<p>This is humorous enough for the outsider, but
sad indeed for the circus man. From long years
of tradition, there still lurks the belief that the
showman is a natural thief, and on circus day the
first intimation of a missing article leads to suspicion
against the nearest person who happens to be
with the “opery.” One day we were pulling in late
and proceeding slowly that the trains might be
“spotted” without the necessity of switching. Repairs
were being made on the road, and beside the
through tracks was a switch filled with hand-cars
belonging to the railroad workmen, upon which
they had left their coats and dinner buckets. No
sooner had the train stopped than a red-necked section
foreman appeared with the town constable and
the announcement that some circus man, the dir-rty
blaggard, had stolen four dinner pails from the
hand-cars as the circus train passed! The show
denied the assertion. The foreman reiterated it.
A crowd began to gather, and there loomed in the
offing the possibility of one of those things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
a circus fears simply because it knows its own
strength—a “Hey Rube,” or general fight. Then,
just when things seemed to be getting beyond control,
the circus “fixer” began to work on a system
of deduction.</p>

<p>If there is anything which a circus man doesn’t
have to bother about, it is something to eat. The
chief means by which a circus manages to exist
without paying high salaries is through providing
good food and plenty of it. Therefore, it was
rather silly to believe that circus men should steal
cold luncheons when there was hot food in the
offing. There was left one real possibility and
the “fixer” led the way to the elephant cars.
There were the four buckets, hidden in the straw,
their contents untouched! All of which turned out,
incidentally, to the show’s advantage. That night,
the section hands brought all their friends to the
show to see the ellyphants that had stolen the dinner
buckets!</p>

<p>They’re a constant round of mischief, those
elephants. Something’s always happening. The
show train was on the down-grade one morning,
late, and fighting to make up time so that it might
at least stand a chance of giving a performance
that afternoon. Suddenly the emergencies clamped
hard, performers scattered around the sleeping
cars, animals howled, cages slipped from their
fastenings and began to wobble about the flat cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
as the air pressure was exerted its utmost to halt
the progress of the speeding section. The conductor,
nonplused, scrambled along the flats, reaching
the first one just as the train halted.</p>

<p>“What’re you stopping for?” he shouted to the
engineer.</p>

<p>“Ask yourself the same question!” came the retort.
“You flagged me down.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy!”</p>

<p>“Am I? Well, take a look for yourself; your
brakeman’s still at it!”</p>

<p>The conductor looked back along the train. Far
in the rear, atop a car, a big piece of canvas was
being waved wildly, frantically. Still wondering,
the conductor retraced his steps.</p>

<p>The train had passed through a small town a
short time before. On the next track had been a
flat car loaded with a new automobile, which, in
turn was covered by a tarpaulin. The opportunity
had been too good to miss. Old Mom had reached
out between the bars of the bull car, yanked the
tarpaulin off on the fly, dragged it within the car,
played tug-of-war with it for a time with the rest
of the elephants, distributing pieces to the remainder
of the herd as the tarpaulin was torn to
shreds, then, in an ecstasy of play, had looked about
for a place high enough in which she might wave
what was left over her head. This had been provided
in a ventilator, which she had shoved open,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
and through which she had extended her trunk,
with the canvas waving to the winds. But up
ahead the engineer had known nothing of the nature
of elephants. He had seen only trouble, and he
had clamped on those emergencies.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, clamping on the emergencies
is about the most frequent thing about the circus
when the elephants are concerned. No one ever
is able to tell what they’re going to do, or when
they’re going to do it. Their prankishness runs
the whole gamut of everything that ever entered
the head of a ten-year-old boy; their curiosity is
worse than that of a monkey; and their uncertainty
is as widespread as that of the proverbial
flighty woman. Which leads to the adventure of
Alice and the tin can.</p>

<p>Alice was a bulbous young lady of some forty-five
seasons under the big tops, and carrying seven
tons of avoirdupois. As sometimes happens when
the feminine goes to bulk, she enjoyed dainty things
and light exercises, such as smashing tin cans. If
there was anything that Alice loved, it was a city
junk heap, where the universe was one vast expense
of cans, to do with as she chose. When Alice
became “logy” during the hot days, or afflicted
with colic, or dumpy and ill-at-ease and down on the
world in general, the bull-keeper gave her none of
the restoratives which he applied to the rest of
the herd. He merely asked the route to the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
dump and led Alice there. That night she would
be her own bulbous self again, happy and serene,
while the tin-can section of the dump heap resembled
the path of a steam roller.</p>

<p>The elephant seemed to gain a strange delight
from the sensation of applying her weight to a can
and squashing it, and the more cans, the more happiness.
I have even seen the elephant deliberately
drop the tail of her predecessor in parade, walk
out of line, apply one massive hoof to a can in a
gutter, squeal with delight, and then trot back to
her work. But Alice mashes tin cans no longer.
She is cured.</p>

<p>It happened about five years ago on the circus
grounds in a small town in California. Alice had
been working. At least, she had been pretending
that she was working. In company with a male elephant
who really was doing all the labor, Alice had
been carefully placing her bulky head about an
eighth of an inch from the back ends of circus
wagons; then, snorting, squealing and apparently
straining every muscle, she had allowed the other
elephant to do all the work while she, in turn, kept
her eye out for a stray can.</p>

<p>It was the noon hour. The parade had returned,
the cookhouse was in full swing, crowded
by performers and workingmen. At one side was
a collection of four or five five-gallon cans, which
once had contained pie apples and which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
opened only enough to allow their contents to be
poured forth by the rushing cookhouse crew. Alice
spotted them. Then Alice looked toward the bull-man.
He was fifty feet away, talking to the boss
of the herd. Quietly—and an elephant can move
so softly that it is almost impossible to hear it—Alice
veered away from the wagon she had been
pretending to push, smashed a can or two, then
halted with a marvelous discovery. There was
something sweet-smelling inside, the remains of the
apple contents. Alice moved to the next can and
investigated. In went the trunk, its “fingers”
working in investigative fashion. The elephant
scooped up a part of the residue, tasted it, liked it
and reached for more, the work this time being a
bit difficult, owing to the fact that there wasn’t
much left. And as Alice pushed the end of her
trunk about inside that can, she allowed a catastrophe
to plump upon her. Absent-mindedly she
forgot that her trunk was inside, and allowed the
old smashing urge to return. Up went a heavy
foot, poised over the can, and then came down!</p>

<p>The next thing the circus knew, one end of the
cookhouse had departed, while performers were
scattering, tables were overturned, canvas fluttered
in the breeze, and a screeching elephant ran wildly
for the free and open country, her trunk waving
wildly in a vain effort to rid itself of a five-gallon can
which had clamped upon it with the tightness of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
vise. A small tree got in the way, then got out,
roots, branches and all. Whistles shrilled on the
circus lot, bull-men ran for fast horses, animal attendants
rushed wildly from their work in the menagerie
to scurry forth upon a path of broken fences,
disabled back yards, uprooted saplings and what-not,
while far in the distance Alice still plunged on, the
can still clinging to its victim, like a cream pitcher on
the head of a cat. A half-hour later they caught
her, chained her and removed the can, while Alice
squealed and trumpeted her delight. Then, free
at last, she looked at the thing which had distressed
her, jumped on it with swift-moving forefeet and
crushed it to a flat mass, gingerly examined it, pronounced
it safe, then raised it and threw it as far
as the sweep of her trunk permitted. After which,
a bit saddened, still grunting and “talking” to herself,
she returned to the show grounds. Now Alice
passes up tin cans. There’s a sort of disdain about
her action. No more does the city dump resemble
a sort of heaven to her. Once was too much.
She’s on the wagon.</p>

<p>However, “the wagon” is not mentioned in the
alcoholic sense. I have yet to see the elephant
that is a believer in prohibition. Which reminds
me of a beer party that still is circus history, and
which led to one of the queerest exhibitions of the
circus business.</p>

<p>It happened in Venice, California, where a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
show maintained its winter quarters for a season.
Things had been a bit slack in the line of entertainment
and the menagerie crew had decided upon a
Dutch lunch, timing it so that there would be no
interruption from the manager. The usual limburger
and wienies were purchased, as well as the
necessary Dill pickles and the case of beer. Everything
was set. The luncheon was spread; the menagerie
crew was about to seat itself when there
came a hurried announcement from the night watchman,
entering on the run:</p>

<p>“Nix! Ditch the eats and the brew! Here
comes the Old Man!”</p>

<p>Frenzied activity. One concerted swoop and
the food had been piled into a covered grain box,
while the case of beer was hidden in the straw behind
the elephant line. When the owner entered
with a group of persons whom he had brought on
a sight-seeing tour, the menagerie house presented
only a dormant place, with men sleeping beneath
the cages and the night watchman propped back in
a chair. The Old Man led the way to the picket
line.</p>

<p>“Now here are the elephants,” he began,
“we—” Then he halted at the sight of one of
the herd nonchalantly taking a drink from a bottle!
“Night watch!” he called. “Rajah’s got a bottle—take
it away from him! He’s liable to cut
himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>But Rajah wouldn’t let go. He flapped his ears
and trumpeted and squealed—but held on. Just
then the owner noticed something more; the fact
that the leader of the herd had raised another
bottle, regarded it calmly, as a toper would test
the clearness of the brew, then placing it on the
ground, had pried off the cap with a big toenail and
now was drinking also! There came an excited accusation
to the effect that his night watchman was
attempting to get the herd drunk. Only one thing
was possible, a confession of the facts, and the
watchman made it. For a moment the owner
frowned. Then:</p>

<p>“You know I kick against drinking around these
quarters. But—” and he grinned—“you’ve given
me a hunch that’s worth it. Tell the boys to go
ahead with their shindig.”</p>

<p>The next day an advertisement appeared. The
circus paid a great share of its winter quarters’ expenses
that year by charging an admission price to
see the elephants drink beer!</p>

<p>Incidentally, it was this same winter which
brought forth another unusual attraction,—that of
the biggest rat-killer in the world. The animal
barn was not the newest place in the world, and
in the wall beside Beelgie’s position in the picket
line, was a rat-hole. One day a rat came forth.</p>

<p>Beelgie jumped, squealed and struck with his
trunk, all at the same instant, and got the rodent!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
The animal men saw him quiver with fright, strain
at his chains, flop about as though to incite the rest
of the herd to flight, fail, and then, pulling back,
regard for a long moment the intruder which he
had killed. At last, satisfied, he turned his attention
upon the rat-hole, and watched it carefully, at
last sliding down on his haunches, with his trunk
tight curled, ready for the next invasion.</p>

<p>All afternoon he remained in that position; no
cat was ever more faithful. But the intruder didn’t
arrive. Whereupon a menagerie man, with a sense
of humor, got an idea.</p>

<p>The next morning Beelgie again took a look at
the rat-hole. And as he did, a rodent popped
forth!</p>

<p>Whang-g-g-g!</p>

<p>An elephantine trunk had descended, and Beelgie,
squealing and fretting, slumped again into his
watchful position. No more than he had set himself
than another appeared, only to pop back into
the hole the minute Beelgie struck at him. Nor
could the worried elephant know that the intruder
was nothing but a stuffed affair, fastened by a
strong rubber band to the interior of the hole and
pulled forth at will by a fine wire in the hands of
the menagerie attendant across the barn. In fact,
Beelgie knew nothing except the fact that the Pied
Piper of Hamelin had nothing on him. Three
rats. Three blows. Three deaths. So far he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
was batting a thousand, and he settled himself for
an all-day vigil. Word of it traveled to the management.
The populace that winter bought the
hay for the elephants. Or rather Beelgie bought
it, as the chief exhibit, because he killed that stuffed
rat, regularly, ten or fifteen times a day until the
show took to the road again, and the townspeople
paid their dimes to see him do it! Everything’s
grist in the circus mill.</p>

<p>Everything but Sunday on the lot. For then,
as a general rule, it’s the other way round, especially
when the elephants are concerned. It is
necessary, except when a long run is to be made and
a tremendous distance bridged between two towns,
for a circus to “Sunday on the lot,” that is: set up
its tents, clean the circus from end to end, repaint
poles, repair damage that has been done during the
hard traveling of the week, rest the horses and
animals, and in general make ready for another
six days of constant effort and fighting against time
that the show may live true to its billing and its
promises of “two performances a day, rain or
shine.” It is a time of general overhauling and
of rest, a time of relaxation; the elephants’ delight,
and the bull-man’s misery. For it is during
Sunday on the lot—just as it is with a
great many small boys on Sunday—that the elephants
think up most of their prankishness. When
a “bull” becomes mischievous, it costs money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>One Sunday night in Texas, the night watchman,
making his final rounds, noticed that every elephant
stood sleepily at the picket pin, and then rolled
under a lion cage for a few hours’ sleep of his own.
Dawn came and he awoke. All the elephants were
still there; everything was quiet. But not so an
hour later!</p>

<p>An irate brickyard keeper had appeared, with a
sleepy-eyed attorney, hastily summoned from bed.
The elephants had ruined his place during the
night! A brick kiln had been demolished, piles of
bricks scattered and destroyed, the mixer overturned
and broken, and the various stacks of tile
shattered. The elephants had done it. There began
the argument.</p>

<p>The elephants couldn’t have done it; they hadn’t
been out of the menagerie! The night watchman
testified to the fact; the menagerie workers told of
having seen the elephants when they left at night
and when they arrived at dawn, perfectly peaceable
at the stake line. The argument grew warmer.
The legal adjuster was summoned, and then some
one suggested that they go to the brickyard.</p>

<p>There the evidence was irrefutable. Everywhere
showed the big tracks of an elephant, and
the chase led back to the circus. There was no
way to controvert the statements of the brickyard
owner now. There were no other elephants within
a thousand miles. And so the search for the culprit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
began, to finish as rapidly. Old Mom, the
leader of the herd, had been caught red-handed.</p>

<p>Or rather, red-legged. The whole rear expanse
of her hind legs, from her hoofs to her hips, was
beautifully rouged with brick dust, where she had
backed up to a pile of bricks and scratched herself!
She had untied the half-hitch of her chain from the
picket stake, carefully carried it in her trunk, gone
under the side wall, enjoyed a night out, wrecked
the brickyard, then returned to the menagerie tent
and with one twisting toss—a trick, incidentally,
which she took delight in teaching other elephants—had
placed that half-hitch back on the stake
again!</p>

<p>Nor was Old Mom’s trick unusual. It seems
characteristic of elephants to desire to take a night
out for themselves every so often.</p>

<p>In August, a few years ago, a big show was
spending Sunday night on a fair grounds. It was
hot, sultry. Three times that day the elephants
had been watered at an old hand-pump close to the
menagerie tent; in fact, the whole circus had been
forced to gain its water from this source.</p>

<p>Three-thirty o’clock came in the morning. The
menagerie superintendent, sleeping in the animal
tent, awoke drowsily to the sound of incessant
pumping. On and on it went—pump, pump, pump,
squeak, squeak, squeak—accompanied by the intermittent
splashing of water. Minute after minute he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
lay there, wondering when those men ever would get
their buckets filled, and speculating as to why circus
workmen should be so eager for water at this
hour of the morning. Then suddenly there came
to him the possibility of fire. He rose hurriedly,
ducked under the side wall, stared into the semidarkness,
and then stood for a solid five minutes,
watching, and laughing. Out there at the pump
was an elephant which evidently had become thirsty
and had sneaked from the picket line, remembering
that pump and the coolness of the water. It was
he that was making the noise, he who was working
the pump. The ground about him was a muddy
mass from the outpourings of the faucet, for there
had been a difficulty about it all. He evidently
had been there for hours, striving to work the
pump-handle with his trunk and at the same time
get it under the spout! At last:</p>

<p>“Hey, Major! What the dickens are you trying
to do there?”</p>

<p>The elephant halted. He had done wrong in
sneaking away, and he knew it. Squealing excitedly,
he jumped from the side of the pump, skidded
in lopsided fashion through the mud, ducked
under the side walling and ran so hard to take his
place in line again that he missed in his calculations
and upset a cage, which cost seventy-five dollars to
repair. There’s usually a bill to be paid somewhere
when an elephant takes a vacation!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE KEEPER OF THE BULLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PLEASE forgive a garrulity when the subject
is elephants and the narrator a circus man.
They are so many-sided, these pachyderms,
so lovable, so exasperating and so fearful, that
their complete story is a far greater one than that
of all the other menagerie animals combined. In
previous chapters there has been a recording of the
sagacity and humorous sides of their natures. But
there is another angle, that of the time when they
become obstreperous, amenable to only one man—the
“keeper of the bulls.”</p>

<p>There are certain well-founded American traditions
regarding the equally American circus which it
seems almost sacrilege to disturb. For instance, it
has been handed from generation to generation that
when a big show goes into territory comprised of
many small towns the circus splits into several parts
like the fabled joint snake and exhibits in three or
four places at once. Again, it’s a certainty that
the fiercest beasts in captivity are the lions and the
tigers, and that if ever one of them should escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
it at once would vent the pent-up rage of years of
imprisonment by killing every one in sight. By
the same line of reasoning the bravest man on the
whole blatant organization must be the lion trainer,
who twice daily—rain or shine—goes into the dens
with these beasts and by a narrow margin comes
forth with skin and body still hanging together.
A different existence indeed from that of the bull-man—who
has nothing to do save to keep his
placid, gigantic, ever-begging charges from eating
too many peanuts, to bring them forth now and
then that they may push a few wagons complacently
around the lot, or trot them into the ring during
the crowded hours of the performance to do the
hootchy-kootchy in their lumbering, comical fashion,
to play a big mouth harp with their trunks until
that laughing, easy-going trainer takes it away from
them, to cavort at a pachydermic game of baseball
or bear the million-dollar beauty around the arena
at the head of the grand entrée. All in all, comparatively
speaking, it would seem much easier than
shooting a blank-cartridged revolver into the bellowing
jaws of a roaring lion. Of course he must
be handy always to warn the uneducated that his
big, clumsy charges hate tobacco, and that they
never forget an injury, but those are only little
idiosyncrasies which bob up even with some human
beings. No matter how placid a person or beast
may be—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>But to get back to the traditions. A show never
splits and never exhibits in several places at once.
The lion and tiger trainer has his troubles, it is true,
but his is not the hardest job of the show. And
the life of the elephant keeper isn’t placid!</p>

<p>For, as it often happens with traditions, the usual
reasoning is wrong. In the first place, the bulls
are not placid, just as they are not clumsy, just as
they do not remember an injury for years and just
as they do not promptly set upon the man who
insults their taste with a juicy plug of tobacco. Perhaps,
long, long ago there may have been a solitary
elephant that disliked nicotine, but times evidently
have changed. To-day a plug of tobacco is
a titbit for any elephant, and more than once is a
visitor’s pocket ransacked by an inquiring trunk
searching for a chew. Elephants eat tobacco just
as they eat sugar cane or pop corn or peanuts or
candy. To them it is a delicacy. Nor is the taste
confined only to chewing tobacco; if you’ll keep
your eyes open the next time you go to a circus you
may even see elephants shooting snipes, where visitors
have dropped their cigar butts along the
picket line. Which ends that.</p>

<p>Their memories are no longer than those of any
other intelligent animal, and their clumsiness and
slowness are things that exist only in appearance.
As for the relationship of ease between the lot of
the keeper of the lions and the keeper of the bulls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the lion trainer leads a bored existence. All that is
necessary for him to do is to keep a whip rein on
a group of beasts, and by a reasonable amount of
care guard his own skin. The keeper of the bulls
has an entirely different task.</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE ACT OF A BREAKAWAY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Inconsistency is a thing which surrounds an elephant
on every side in his life in the circus. Just as
he is the best-liked beast of the menagerie, so is he
the most feared. Just as he is the thing that must
be counted upon literally to drag the show out of
the mud when the mire of a wet circus lot has sunk
every wagon to the wheel hubs and so entangled the
heavy conveyances that horseflesh, even tractors,
lose their efficiency, so on the very next day he may
wreck everything he has worked so hard to save.
He will swing forward confidently to the attack,
should a lion make a breakaway, but the proximity
of a mouse or even a small, harmless snake on a
country wayside is the signal for hysteria. He will
carry a cannon on his back into a performance and
stand immobile while the booming charge breaks
in deafening fashion above him, and then, on the
next Fourth of July, “go flighty” at the popping
of a penny firecracker. He will remain at a
picket line through confusion and turmoil while
thousands of persons crowd about him, then pull
up stakes and chase the daylights out of a candy
vender who consistently offends him by selling
dainties among the show goers instead of distributing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
them free along the elephant line. He is the
most sagacious animal in captivity, yet, when he
becomes frightened he doesn’t know enough to
turn out of the way of a brick building. His daily
food consists of fully two hundred pounds of roughage,
a few pounds of coal which he munches greedily
if he can but get it, a bushel or so of grain, ten
or twenty pounds of pure dirt—chocolate loam or
swamp muck preferred—and a tub or two of water,
yet he will quit it all gladly for one lonely peanut or
a piece of candy. In the circus world they’ve
changed an old, old expression to fit their own
needs:</p>

<p>“Inconsistency—thy name is elephant!”</p>

<p>For, it seems, the paradox is a continual thing
with the great pachyderms which form the backbone
of practically every circus. There is never a
time in which they are not depended upon to save
the show in times of late arrivals, muddy or sandy
lots, or on long hauls from the unloading runs to the
exhibition grounds, when the two or three tons of
flesh and bone and muscle which every elephant possesses
are thrown into play to augment the efforts
of the straining draft stock and chugging tractors.
Yet, by the same token, upon one man and one alone,
depends the task of keeping them the placid, humorous
clowns which they really should be, the keeper
of the bulls.</p>

<p>In explanation, a herd of elephants—and in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of the big circuses a herd will number as high as
twenty-five members—is built upon the monarchial
system, with a princess or two, a queen and a king
in control. The princesses and queen are elephants;
the only male ruler allowed is the superintendent
of the herd, the man to whom the queen,
or leader, vows allegiance. No matter what other
men may do, what other men may command, if the
keeper of the herd decides otherwise, then otherwise
is the result. The leader obeys him above all
others; the princesses obey her, and the male members
tag along in a group of bulky camp followers,
citizens, agitators and revolutionists. The males
make the trouble in an elephant monarchy, the females
make the laws and enforce them.</p>

<p>As an example: Old Mom and her herd were in
Canada several years ago, and one of its stands
was Winnipeg. The performances were dated for
Monday and, as is usual with a circus, the show had
arrived in town a day ahead. The tents had been
erected, the seats placed, the animals fed and exercised,
the ring curbs fastened into position, the
hippodrome track smoothed into readiness, the rigging
for the various aerial acts set, and the circus
had settled to rest.</p>

<p>In the menagerie the lions and tigers nodded
sleepily, with nothing to disturb them from their
Sunday slothfulness. The elephant picket line was
calm and peaceful, the long trunks weaving lazily at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the transference of a full portion of roughage from
ground to mouth. Group by group the circus people
departed from the lot, townward bound, for the
usual Sunday stroll and the luxury of a night in a
hotel instead of the cramped berths of the sleepers.
Only the watchmen were left about the various
tents, only the assistants in the menagerie.</p>

<p>Night came, starlit and peaceful. The torches
began to gleam about the circus grounds, spots of
limited brilliance barely sufficient to provide protection
against the pitfalls of stakes and wagon
tongues and tight-pulled guy ropes. Hours passed
in torpid peace. Down town the superintendent of
the elephant herd, Fred Alispaw, seated himself at
the table of a night restaurant and glanced across
toward his wife, awaiting her decision on the menu
of an after-theater supper. He called a waiter.
He began the giving of an order. Then suddenly
the café, the street, the city were in darkness, following
a green blaze of lightning and its consequent
crash of thunder. A moment more and the rain
was pelting, borne at the fore of a forty-mile gale.
Winnipeg all in a second had become a storm-stricken
city, its lights extinguished by a lightning
bolt which had struck one of the main feed wires, its
street-car service blocked, its streets running small
rivers from the rain, its every activity for the moment
halted. In the café diners laughed, struck
matches and waited for the lights to come on again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
all but one man, stumbling through the darkness
toward the doorway, Fred Alispaw, keeper of the
bulls.</p>

<p>“Stay here until the lights come on!” he ordered
hastily of his wife. “I’ve got to get to the lot!”</p>

<p>“But the cars are stopped.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that. I’ll find a taxi! I’ve got to
get to the lot!”</p>

<p>Out into the sheetlike rain he went, to leap to the
running board of the first passing automobile and
literally commandeer it for a trip to the circus
grounds several miles away. His experience with
elephants and the instinctive knowledge of what the
beasts might do under circumstances such as this
demanded swift action, and plenty of it. More,
intuition proved correct!</p>

<p>The storm had struck as suddenly at the circus
grounds as in the city. With the first flash of
lightning the wind had swept through the menagerie
tent with galelike force, lifting the side
walling and causing it to slap and bellow and snap
in queer ghostly fashion. The elephant herd,
peaceful and drowsing at its double row of stakes
only a moment before, had heard and seen!</p>

<p>There was no keeper to reassure them; only assistants.
To an elephant an assistant counts for
little if the supreme voice is absent, and right at that
moment Alispaw was miles away. In vain the menagerie
men sank their bull-hooks into the ears of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the plunging charges, then, bobbing about like so
many plummets, strove in vain to hold the beasts in
line. Even Old Mom, the head of the herd, had
become panicky with the rest, not from fear of the
storm but from the fright caused by the sight of
that twisting, writhing side wall as it had shown for
an instant in the glare of the lightning. To the
elephants it represented some unknown bellowing
monster about to attack; the unexplained thing always
means trouble in an elephant herd. So the
stampede had begun.</p>

<p>One by one the extra stakes were dragged from
the ground. One by one the frantic animal attendants
were thrown aside or knocked down by the
flail-like blows of tossing trunks. The thunder
now bore an obbligato of screaming, hissing cat animals,
crouched in fear in their dens, of shouting
men, of rending stakes, clanking chains and squealing,
trumpeting elephants. Then still another
thunder, that of ton-heavy bodies plunging across
the menagerie tent, the crashing of timbers as they
knocked poles and cages from their path, and the
stampede of the nine-elephant herd was on! A
moment later the stages, the poles, the seats and
grand stand of the main tent were splintering and
snapping as some sixty thousand pounds of fear-maddened
elephant flesh tore madly here and there
in the big inclosure, rushing wildly, then wheeling
as frantically in the other direction as a lightning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
flash showed that writhing, flapping thing of wind-blown
canvas surrounding them on every side.
Greater and greater the frenzy became; in the milling
two of the males collided and began to fight
with swift smashing rushes and lashing trunks.
Louder and louder became the squealing and
trumpeting—suddenly to lull. A voice had come
faintly from the darkness of the menagerie tent—every
torch long had been extinguished—a voice
which caused Old Mom to turn and to trumpet
with a new note.</p>

<p>“Mom—Mom! Here I am!”</p>

<p>Again the call sounded and Old Mom answered,
the queen obeying the command of her overlord.
The fighting ceased. A new signal sounded from
the throat of Old Mom. The elephants steadied.
A moment later Alispaw, standing in the connection
between the menagerie and the main tent, saw revealed
in a flash of lightning a great hulking shadow
coming slowly but steadily toward him, while in
the rear there followed eight others, practically
abreast! Old Mom had heard the voice she
sought. That was enough!</p>

<p class="caption">KAS AND MO WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN AMERICA.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the fight had only begun. The storm now
was taking on a new intensity, a new fury, and the
trainer knew that he had but two allies, Mom and
Frieda, her elephantine lady in waiting. As soon
as possible he caught the two elephants by their
ears and stood between them, talking to them, reassuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
them, while they wrapped their trunks
about him and squealed their delight, while the
rest of the herd milled and trumpeted about them,
each crowding its utmost to be near the thing which
to them meant safety. For nearly an hour it continued,
with the fate of the show in the hands of
one man, literally buried in a bumping, jostling mass
of thirty tons of frightened elephants—one man
whom they trusted and whose presence alone could
hold them against a new panic. Then slowly, with
the aid of his assistants and a lone flickering torch,
he began the task of working the mammals back to
their picket line.</p>

<p>For Mom and for Frieda it was comparatively
easy. For the rest it was a far more difficult task.
Alispaw could not be in every place at once, and the
moment the herd became strung out to the slightest
degree there would be a concerted rush to be near
the lead elephants and the keeper who guided them.
In vain the assistants strove to drive them back, and
at last one of the men, losing his head, struck violently
at one of the beasts with an iron-tipped tent
stake, only to miscalculate. The blow struck Alispaw,
and he dropped unconscious, and the note of
fright in Old Mom’s bellow brought a new spasm
of fear and a resumption of the milling to the rest
of the herd.</p>

<p>Once more they circled and crowded—all but
one. That one was Old Mom, half crouched over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the prostrate trainer, whimpering and touching him
with her trunk, and through her frightened curiosity
forming a bulwark against the rest of the
surging herd. For a full five minutes this continued;
then, dizzy and reeling, the keeper crawled to
his feet and renewed his calls of assurance. The
storm lessened. Slowly Old Mom wheeled into
place at the picket line and submitted to her chains.
Frieda came beside her; then, still trembling, still
grunting and squealing and protesting, the rest followed.
Daylight found the picket line again a
thing of comparatively peaceful elephants, and all
because of one man!</p>

<p>Nor is this at all unusual. Strictly otherwise.
With the Barnum and Bailey Circus is a quiet
gentle-voiced man who has been the keeper of the
show’s big herd of elephants for more than a
quarter of a century, while his aid at the head of
the herd is an ancient lady of some eighty-five summers
who can read his every intonation, his every
command, and who forces her will upon the rest
of the herd, or knows the reason why! In elephantdom
there appears to be a certain respect for
superiority; the leader of the herd attacks with impunity
any beast under her control, no matter how
fierce it may be, how big or how favored in fighting
proclivities. In the winter quarters of one of
the Western circuses is a glaring patch of cement
work which a few years ago stopped up a gaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
hole of some ten feet in diameter where a leader
elephant butted a recalcitrant member of her herd
through an eighteen-inch brick wall! When the
keeper of a herd has the allegiance of that herd’s
leader he has fought half his battle. But that
keeper may be forced to leave suddenly, and what
then?</p>

<p>That’s exactly the question every circus owner
asks when there is a sudden shift in the superintendency
of the elephant line, and in which there is
no time to work in a new keeper gradually as the
person in command. More than once it has meant
trouble, not only to the circus but to the elephant.
In view of this, enter Snyder.</p>

<p>They called him the biggest elephant in captivity.
Whether he was or not, he was one of the best
performers, one of the most intractable, and at the
same time one of the most valuable. When Snyder
departed this life it meant that a twenty-five
thousand-dollar performing tusker, trained to walk
on his hind hoofs about the whole circumference of
the hippodrome track, at the same time carrying his
trainer on his three-foot tusks, left the circus world
forever. As a result his trainers were selected
with care and the slightest evidence of must, or
badness, in his eyes was the signal for instant and
various activities to hold him from a stampede.
Far better to keep a valuable elephant out of
parades and performances—even to imprison him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
day after day in the bull cars—than to run the
risk of a rampage which may end in the necessity
for an execution.</p>

<p>Consequently Henry Boucher, a trainer, was
eased into Snyder’s life with all the care of the
launching of a yacht when his old keeper resigned
a few years ago. The elephant gradually accepted
his new master, then came to love him. Two years
passed, in which Boucher held the big performer
safe from runaways, stampedes and temperamental
outbreaks. Then, a year ago, in Salina, Kansas,
the trainer became violently ill and was forced to
leave the circus on short notice.</p>

<p>The next day Snyder grunted and snorted and
trumpeted in vain. His trainer was gone. That
afternoon the beast was kept out of performance,
and he weaved uneasily at his picket chain, slapping
his trunk viciously at every passing candy seller—how
every elephant hates them—even refusing
food. His eyes began to cloud slightly, the first
indication of must. The matinée performance
ended, and an assistant, assigned to the position of
substitute trainer, released the chain which held the
be-tusked brute and led him into the empty big top,
or main tent, for a first rehearsal under new
management.</p>

<p>Snyder listened to just one command. Then
with a rush he knocked the substitute from his path,
splintered the quarter poles which crisscrossed before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
him, smashed a path through a tier of seats,
broke through the side walling, lowered his head,
then with a great butting lurch overturned the first
wagon he saw, headed back through the side walling
of the menagerie, seized the monkey cage at its
tongue base with his trunk and threw it from him
like a boy throwing a baseball. The cat animals
began to roar and screech; he made for the dens,
one by one, and overturned them. The hippopotamus
grunted excitedly in his five-ton den, and
Snyder rushed for it like the maddened thing he
was; an impact followed like the crashing of runaway
engines, and the den, with its bulky freight,
catapulted through the side wall and ten feet clear
of the tent.</p>

<p>They tried to surround him by peaceful elephants,
to mingle him with the rest of the herd and
thus return him to captivity. It was useless.
Snyder had turned renegade; he recognized no
superior and he fought the leader of the herd with
the same frenzy that he fought any inanimate object
which blocked his path. So at last they sent
for rifles; nor was it long before twenty-five thousand
dollars in elephant flesh became only an object
for a museum. Four steel bullets in his brain had
ended the career of an elephant which had refused
to recognize any one but the master of his choice.</p>

<p>So you see there are grounds for that circus saying
regarding inconsistency. Once an elephant becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
thoroughly angry, little can block his path.
Yet in the regular course of events that same elephant
actually can be afraid of his own shadow!</p>

<p>On one of the big shows are Kas and Mo, named
respectively and respectfully for Kansas and Missouri.
Both are what are known to the bull-men
as agitators, both flighty, unreasoning, and seemingly
always anxious to find something that will
serve as an excuse for trouble. Both also are
punks, the circus name for anything not yet full grown,
and the lack of maturity in age may account
for the equal absence of steadiness in character.
In any event their course has been a stormy one.
Their first day on the show, when they arrived
fresh from India in the care of a Singhalese, ended
with a general stampede of the entire herd when
the two punks decided to run straight through it
without an introduction; the panic, although it
lasted only the length of a city block, resulted in
nearly a thousand dollars in damages. The first
windy day after their arrival brought a breakaway
on their part, and the danger of a like action on the
part of the adult members of the herd. The first
parade was one of constant attempts at runaways
and the smashing of a two-hundred-dollar plate-glass
window. Finally there came the time when,
at the slightest hint of any unusual happening, Kas
and Mo were loaded hurriedly into the first available
wagon and sent unceremoniously to the cars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
This continued during the entire first season.</p>

<p>However, elephant trainers are persistent beings,
and all that winter the keeper of the herd labored
with Kas and Mo to bring them to a condition of
dependability. To every possible noise, action and
circumstance that might cause fear on their part
they were subjected, until the flighty brutes were
considered proof against anything that might occur
on a circus lot. Then they were turned over to
Lucia Zora, wife of the menagerie superintendent,
for a novelty in elephant training—the driving of
the diminutive pachyderms in tandem style before a
flower-bedecked two-wheel cart. It really seemed
that Kas and Mo had reformed. They learned
quickly; they obeyed every command.</p>

<p>Springtime came and the show went forth to its
first exhibition stand, rehearsing, as is usual, for
three days before the opening date. Everything
was lovely. Kas and Mo, garlanded and festooned
with strands of paper flowers, took their place in
the grand entrée like veterans. Zora was pleased.
So was the keeper of the bulls. So was the owner
of the show. So was every one. The past was
forgotten.</p>

<p>The opening day arrived. Kas and Mo went
into parade with their woman trainer, their garlands
of roses and their high-wheeled cart, looking
neither to the right nor to the left. At the afternoon
performance they moved into their position in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
the elephant section of the grand entrée in a manner
both joyous and faithful. Night arrived, the
chandeliers gleamed, the signal to prepare for
entrée sounded from the whistle of the equestrian
director, and the punks took their place at the head
of the section, awaiting the time when the rest of
the entrée should emerge from the flags, or performers’
entrance, that they, with the remainder
of the menagerie exhibits, might enter at the other
end of the tent, thus filling the hippodrome track
simultaneously. At the head of the tandem was
Kas, somewhat anxiously awaiting the signal to
start. At the left was a low-hung chandelier which
caught the beast’s body and silhouetted it against
the near-by side wall of the menagerie tent. Beyond
was a main tent filled with gaping spectators,
staring vapidly toward the empty rings and stages
and hippodrome track, waiting for the show to
begin. And just then Kas saw its shadow on the
side wall.</p>

<p>The punk grunted and raised its trunk. Over at
the side wall that mysterious thing raised its trunk
also. Kas fidgeted. So did the shadow. The big
ears of Kas distended in fright. Over there a pair
of black ears moved in unison. Everything that
Kas did was immediately aped by that thing on the
wall. It was too much.</p>

<p>A squeal, a snort, then suddenly the crowded tent
saw a tandem team of elephants pitch through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
gay dividing curtain and swing into the hippodrome
track at full speed, the rose-bedecked cart careening
behind them on one wabbling wheel, and behind
this the entire elephant herd, following excitedly
and without a reason save the fact that Kas and
Mo were leading the way. A moment later the
cart hit a ring curb, while the bespangled Lucia
Zora dived gracefully and far through the air to
a dazed position on a pile of canvas, and the runaway
elephant parade went on!</p>

<p>Around the hippodrome track they thundered,
two squealing baby elephants in the lead, ten excited,
bewildered adult beasts in the rear, and the
whole shouting, panting menagerie force trailing
vainly in their dust. The first curve came and the
punks left their cart leaning in drunken, awry fashion
where it had collided with a center-pole. The
second, and they tangled in their flower-decorated
harness, but they went on! A third curve, a
fourth, then straight through the dividing curtain
they plunged again, the rest of the herd after them,
and back to their places in the picket line! Meanwhile
out there in the main tent an amused crowd
stared again at an empty hippodrome track, not
knowing whether the whole thing had been an accident
or some new form of elephant race!</p>

<p>Naturally it is an impossibility for any man or
set of men to maintain an unbroken record of halting
panics. Their charges are too big, too possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
with temperament, too prone to become
frightened at the most puerile things for a keeper
always to outguess them and outmaneuver them.
However, the number of panics on the part of the
various elephant herds in which damage is caused
or the big brutes actually succeed in getting away
is so far over-shadowed by the attempts at revolt
which are broken up in their inception that there
is not an opportunity for comparison. Hardly a
day passes among the various circuses that at least
one elephant does not decide to pit his will against
that of the man in charge. But actual panics, with
consequent damage, happen extremely seldom. In
fact, strange as it may seem, the actual breakaways
of any extent in circus history are so few that they
number less than a score. When it is considered
that there are fully fifty circuses in America which
possess elephants, some idea may be gained of the
efficacy of those men who manage the herds, who day
after day, outguess and outgeneral their charges—the
keepers of the bulls. But one hears little of
these clashes of will. In the life of the keeper
of the bulls his failures become public property;
his successes are reflected in his pay envelope
only, and the crowd often goes home without even
the thrill of knowing that an elephantine revolution
was nipped in the making.</p>

<p>For instance, few persons in Berkeley, California,
remember an elephant stampede in that city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
The very persons who saw it probably would be
willing to take oath that nothing of the kind ever
happened.</p>

<p>Yet there was a stampede, and one that for at
least five minutes threatened to be extremely serious.</p>

<p>Berkeley, in the circus dictionary, is a “rah-rah”
town, a feared thing to a menagerie department.
It means a college, and the traditional enmity that
has grown up between tent shows and student bodies
through long years of fights and troubles occasioned
by the overexuberance of youth, and the
disturbances that almost invariably follow the
attendance at a performance of a large body of
students with their class yells, their chain steps
and snake dances. Circuses are composed of high-strung
persons who risk their lives as a part of their
daily work, and of equally high-strung horses and
other animals. Disturbances during the performances
are not to their liking.</p>

<p>But on this particular morning in Berkeley things
apparently were going exceeding well.</p>

<p>The parade had started on time from the lot,
and now was traversing the longest and most
crowded street of the whole route. The bands
were blaring happily. The bull section, numbering
some twelve animals, was shuffling along the
asphalt in peace and contentment.</p>

<p>Suddenly from around a corner there swung into
line with the parade a lock-step crew of some three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
hundred students, their feet stamping the pavement
in unison, their lips chanting a monotonous
college song, joining the procession directly behind
the bull section. The elephant keepers spurred
up their horses and attempted to stop the demonstration.
The college men simply grinned at them
and tramped steadily on. Time after time the
bull-men gave warning of what the result of the
monotonous chant and still more monotonous tramp-tramp-tramp
of hundreds of stamping feet might
be. The parade marshal looked around wildly for
police. They were somewhere else. He strove to
block the marching line with his horse. They
circled him and went on, still beside the shuffling
bull line.</p>

<p>Now ears were distending. Piglike eyes were
rolling in their too small sockets. Heavy skins
were beginning to wrinkle.</p>

<p>At last there came a call from Shorty, the head
keeper, and the elephant men gave up their task.
“Don’t try to break up that line. If they won’t
stop let ’em go. These bulls’ll break at the first
rough-house. Stand by to tail ’em down!”</p>

<p>Into position shot the assistants, each ready to
dig his spurs into his horse at the first sign of a
break. Far ahead went Shorty, taking his position
just behind the gigantic trembling Mary, bearing
the Ten Thousand Dollar Queen of the Harem at
the head of the section, a harem beauty who, incidentally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
just at that moment wished she was back
in Coshocton; in fact, anywhere except in that bobbing
howdah. Leader Mary was beginning to
shimmy slightly with increased fright, and her
shuffle on the hot asphalt carried a new wiggle of
impending danger. Then the marching three hundred
broke into a weird class yell, and the stampede
began.</p>

<p>Straight forward went Leader Mary, to scrape
a lion’s cage, to swerve slightly to one side, then,
with the Ten Thousand Dollar Queen of the Harem
squawking aimlessly in the howdah, to lead off in
a wild scramble straight down the street, with the
rest of the herd smashing along in her rear. Then
it was that the preparations of Shorty, the keeper
of the bulls, went into execution.</p>

<p>At the first move of the elephant section the
horses of keepers moved also—into a furious pace,
for the speed of an elephant is a deceptive thing,
and it is a good horse that can keep abreast of him,
once he unlimbers into full steam ahead. The
stamping college men were left behind now; even
the front section of the parade with its suddenly
hushed band and blank-faced clowns was passed
almost in an instant. Out of them all only the Ten
Thousand Dollar Queen of the Harem was left,
still bouncing in her howdah, still squealing and
squawking, while, spurs deep in their horses, the
elephant men strove their best to keep abreast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the fast-traveling bull section, echoing and reëchoing
the shout of Shorty at the head of the line:</p>

<p>“Hi there! Mule up! Mule up there, Mary!
Frieda—Frenchy—Sultan—tails! Tails there—tails!”</p>

<p>It was a double command, which traveled along
the line and back again as fast as men could voice
it, the order to run, and at the same time for each
elephant to grasp the tail of the beast before him.
Blocks passed while throats grew hoarse, and while
the thick-packed throngs of the curbings stared
vacuously, wondering why the circus should be in
such a hurry to get its elephants out of the line of
march.</p>

<p>But never a warning sounded, never a hint that
a panic was in progress; only that repeated and
re-repeated command:</p>

<p>“Tails there! Mule up, you! Tails—tails!”
All of it meant an experiment in elephant psychology,
and one that had been tried many times before.
At last the command sank in. The second
elephant of the line grasped the tail of Leader
Mary and continued to run. The third elephant
obeyed; the fourth, the fifth, and on through the
whole section.</p>

<p>But the command continued:</p>

<p>“Mule up there—mule up! Tails!”</p>

<p>Another two blocks and the command changed;
more, the elephant line obeyed. A block after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
that, and the whole section was peacefully shuffling
along again, simply through the fact that the frightened
beasts had been made to believe that their
trainer really desired them to run, and that in their
breakaway they were merely carrying out orders.
Nor could they know that in obeying the command
of tails, they handicapped themselves so that the
speed of one could be no greater than that of another,
and that as long as the leader kept to a
straight line, so must the rest.</p>

<p>Further, the occupation of their single-track
minds in the execution of an order which coincided
with their natural tendencies had wiped out in forgetfulness
the fact that something had threatened
them, and brought to them the belief that their
trainer merely was running them away from an
obnoxious thing. Therefore, when the command
came to slow down they did so in confidence, and in
the assurance that any danger was over. Many a
person went that day from watching the parade,
wondering perhaps why the elephant trainer should
desire to put his beasts through their paces. But
few of them realized that the little play of speed
had saved not only the circus but the downtown
section of Berkeley, with its thronged sidewalks,
from disaster.</p>

<p>The trick works time after time; it is the stand-by
of the elephant keeper, his first hope at the
beginning of a breakaway. A few years ago, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Parkersburg, West Virginia, a circus had just
arrived on the lot, with the consequent confusion
of setting up, of yowling caged animals, of lumbering,
trucking wagons, and trotting ring stock as
the various elements of the show traveled into position.
Standing near the menagerie tent were two
elephants, secured side by side with neck chains,
which fastened one to the other. The keeper of
the herd was within the tent, superintending the
staking out of the picket line, and leaving the two
big beasts in the care of an assistant until he should
call for them. But a second later he was outside
the tent and in action. The chained bulls had lost
their heads.</p>

<p>As usual, the most innocent thing in the world had
caused it, simply the bucking of a hippodrome, or
race horse, as he had passed on the way to the stable
tents. But that had been enough, and neck and
neck the two elephants had started across the lot.
A collision with a wagon, and the assistant, clinging
until this moment to a bull-hook fastened in an
elephantine ear, ceased to trouble or impede their
flight. Over went the wagon; on went the bulls.
Another wagon blocked their path, and with a side-swipe
they capsized it, then swerving slightly in their
course they straddled, quite by accident, the rear of
a heavy pole wagon with their connecting chains,
and began to twist madly in their efforts to free
themselves and travel onward to more destruction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
But just then a new element entered, the keeper of
the bulls.</p>

<p>“Pick it up there!” he shouted. “Sandow!
Morgan! Pick it up—pick it up!”</p>

<p>It was the command to push, and without realizing
that they were yielding their freedom the elephants
strained forward. A poler hurried into
position at the tongue of the wagon to guide
it, while from the rear came in ever-increasing
forcefulness:</p>

<p>“That’s right—pick it up! Pick it up there—let’s
go now—pick it up! Morgan—Sandow!
Shake a leg there—pick it up!”</p>

<p>The elephants picked it up. With the poler guiding
the way, they took that wagon on a half-trot
across the circus lot and back again, around the
big top and up to the midway, and finally for a trip
of a few blocks down the street and return, the
keeper still commanding them, still prodding them
with his bull-hook, still obsessed with the desire
that they pick it up. At last, panting and wabbly,
the two recalcitrant elephants brought the wagon
back into the exact position where it had rested at
the time of their collision and were allowed to
slow their pace. A bull-hook caught in a fanlike
ear.</p>

<p>“Now you two come over here and straighten up
this damage!” commanded the keeper, and meekly
the twain obeyed, to set their trunks under the sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
of the wagons they had capsized and unprotestingly
raised them into position again. Five minutes
later they were in place at the picket line, peaceful
and calm, their fright effaced, ready for the
bugle call of parade.</p>

<p>With it all, the life of a bull-keeper is a thing of
constant gambling. He has none of the assurances
with which the performers of other beasts are
blessed; the lion or tiger trainer has his cages, and
the knowledge that even should a vicious cat escape,
a bullet or two from a heavy-calibered revolver at
close range can finish him. It takes a steel-jacketed
army bullet to make an elephant even realize he’s
being shot!</p>

<p>More, the beasts are too big to be caged. They
are too strong for anything except a perfect network
of drop-forged chains. Even then, nothing
short of a pile driver can set wood deep enough into
the ground to hold them when they really desire
to run. It’s wholly a matter of a good leader of
the herd, good princesses working under her, the
hope that there are few agitators or revolutionists
in the rest of the monarchy, and a strong trust in
fate and the breaks of circumstance. For even the
elephant keeper never knows what may start his
difficulties. An invasion of fleas in the sandy districts
of the West can do it; an elephant’s hide can
turn a leaden revolver bullet, but it can’t stand
fleas! There’s trouble even in mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>For the flea and the mosquito evidently have
more judgment regarding the points of vulnerability
in an elephant’s hide than does a bullet.
They select the soft spots behind the ears, the
eyelids and tender mouth and flanks for their work,
and once they arrive in numbers, trouble begins. It
is not at all unusual to see elephants being dosed
with flea preventives. The mosquito pest is far
more rare, but at least one runaway is chargeable
to this cause.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the instance gave another credit
mark to the career of Old Mom, and another
example of at least one elephant with common sense.
The show was making a Sunday run in Canada by
which it bridged a long expanse of territory between
money-making stands, heading far into the north of
the Dominion, where few shows had exhibited and
where the natives would be glad to part with a
double admission price for the pleasure of seeing
a bigger circus than usual. The run had been
preceded by several days of moist, mosquito-breeding
weather, with the result that when the
show train made a feed stop at a small prairie settlement,
and the elephants were unloaded for a trip
of half a mile to the nearest water, the insects
swarmed in such millions that they almost obliterated
the lettering of the railroad cars. About the
railroad tracks several hundred smudges were
lighted, thus freeing that exact territory from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
pests, but the elephants weren’t fortunate. They
were forced to travel out into the country for water,
and the mosquitoes went with them.</p>

<p>By the time the watering process was finished
every elephant was crusted with stinging, poisonous
insects and squealing with discomfort. They pulled
from their keepers; in vain Old Mom, obeying the
commands of Alispaw, strove to hold them in line.
She bellowed, she butted, she lashed with her
trunk—but to no purpose. A moment more and
an inveterate agitator made the break, followed
by two others, and instantly the rest of the herd
rushed after them. More, Old Mom broke from
the bull-hooked grasp of her keeper, and with
Frieda, her handmaiden, beside her, swung madly
into flight also!</p>

<p>It seemed that at last the ability of Old Mom
to command a situation was lost. Faster and faster
she went, passing the slower members of the herd,
and at last forcing her way to the very front of the
stampede, Frieda puffing along in her wake. For
a full eighth of a mile she led the rush straight out
into the prairie; then the pursuers, far in the rear,
noticed that she was beginning to turn in her course.
Soon she had made a semicircle and was leading
the plunging herd straight back in the direction
of the cars.</p>

<p>Thundering on they went, the workmen and
clustered performers parting spasmodically as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
approached the runs, Old Mom still in the lead, and
heading, it seemed, on a straight path for the sleeping
cars and the crash which seemed inevitable.
Once an elephant loses its head it takes no cognizance
of what may be before it; its mentality knows
a beeline only, no matter if the obstruction be a
stone quarry.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer! Then it suddenly became evident
that Old Mom evidently was in full possession
of her faculties—and a bright idea. At the tracks
she swerved, and while horses and workmen
scurried for safety, she led the way straight to the
elephant cars and climbed in!</p>

<p>The runs, or running board by which the beasts
usually made their entrance and exit had been removed
in preparation for the switching of the cars.
So the climbing operation was a literal one. With
the rest of the bulls behind her, Old Mom, grunting
and squealing, made the ascent, and Frieda
followed.</p>

<p>Then in the semidarkness of the smudge-filled
car she trumpeted happily, and the rest of the herd
crowded in after her. A stampede of nearly a
mile was over without a cent of damage.</p>

<p>In fact, Old Mom, with her faith and her levelheadedness,
has meant salvation in many an instance.
I once saw this sensible old elephant lead her herd
across the cable bridge which connects Wheeling,
West Virginia, with the Ohio side, with a storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
in progress, the surroundings inky black, the rain
pelting, the keepers almost as terrified as the
brutes, with the beams of the bridge cracking from
overweight, and the structure itself swinging fully
eight feet from side to side! Below was a sheer
drop to the Ohio River; two elephants had become
panic-stricken and had broken from the bull-man
in attendance, rushing frantically forward to the
protection of their leader. The rest of the herd
had begun to mill, with only a thirty-foot width
of bridge as their arena; bull-men were befuddled
and nearly blinded by the pelting rain. Yet Old
Mom held true to the commands of her trainer,
and with weird trumpetings which sounded sharp
above even the rush of wind and crackling of thunder,
someway, somehow, reassured her herd. Then
with the ever-present Frieda at her side, she began
to lead the way, slow step after slow step to the
opposite side.</p>

<p>That very slowness was the salvation of the herd;
instinctively they knew that she was testing the
bridge, and by some sort of animal understanding,
did likewise. The rocking lessened. A half-hour
later Old Mom brought her charges safe out at
the other side, every elephant walking in comical,
gingerly fashion for a full block after leaving the
structure, for all the world like overgrown fat
boys trying to negotiate an area of eggshells.</p>

<p>Yet even Mom has her failings, her likes and dislikes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
and once, at least, her discipline has ended in
tragedy. Woeful is the life of the subject elephant
that defies Old Mom, ancient though she may be.
Well past the hundred-year mark in age, dependable
when every other bull of the picket line is
frantic, there is one failing; Old Mom is a disciplinarian
to the point of being a martinet. More than
that, she is as foolish in her likes as a person in
second childhood, and her favorite is the worst
trouble-maker of the whole herd!</p>

<p>Long ago they named him Billy, a quarrelsome,
snobby little runt of an elephant that spends half
his time in winter quarters striving to slap the daylights
out of the hoglike old hippopotamus that wallows
in his permanent tank near the picket line, and
the remainder of his existence in stealing feed from
the rest of the elephants. Nor does one of that
bull line dare to protest! Immediately there comes
a squeal from Billy, and from farther down the line
a bellow of anger from Old Mom, where, eyes glaring,
trunk twisting, ears wide, she wheels forward
toward her picket pin and prepares to free herself
that she may punish the offender. For punishment
is swift and sure to those who offend her by offending
her pet. Billy, to Old Mom, is a little angel.
He can do no wrong. To the rest of the herd he is
an obnoxious, selfish, obtrusive little devil that can
do no right. They hate him. But they submit,
rather than feel the thump of Old Mom’s trunk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
or the pile-driver impact of her hard skull. Winter
quarters or the road, it is all the same. Old
Mom has taught her little angel her secrets of escape,
with the result that he wanders the elephant
line at will, in spite of stakes, bonds or even keepers.
Old Mom’s protection of Billy extends to
humans, and the runt does as he pleases.</p>

<p>For eight years had this continued when the
tragedy came. For eight years, Floto, the stodgiest,
most amiable male member of the herd, had
submitted to every indignity one elephant can heap
upon another. Billy had stolen his feed. Billy
had edged forward when visitors arrived with peanuts,
and literally taken them out of Floto’s trunk.
Floto had protested and been punished, and so
Floto had endured. But during those eight years
the hatred was being stored against a day of
judgment. And near the end of the season, at
Orange, Texas, it came.</p>

<p>The press services which carried the story of that
day’s event announced that some one had given
Floto a chew of tobacco and that he had gone mad
because of it. But that was only tradition and a
guess. Floto was one of the best tobacco eaters of
the picket line. And Floto had something more on
his mind than a bad taste. The story of his
death is one of rebellion and revenge.</p>

<p>Old Mom was out on the lot, busily pushing the
wagons into position for the loading of the night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
The matinée was over. The menagerie tent was
drowsing in that calm which intervenes between the
afternoon show and the gleaming chandeliers of
night. Floto was at his picket pin, glorying in his
portion of hay. Then came Billy.</p>

<p>He rooted in as usual and began to gobble
Floto’s feed share, even as he had done for eight
years. But this time Old Mom was not there to
protect him. Floto snorted and warned the runt
out of his way. But the fat little Billy only grunted
and reached for another trunkful. It was the final
insult.</p>

<p>A weird trumpet blast, and the three-ton Floto
rose high on his haunches. Then with a sudden
thumping drop, he came to all fours again, and
seizing his piggish enemy in his trunk, raised him
squealing over his head, only to throw him, breathless,
to the ground, and then, breaking his stay
chains, to leap upon his pudgy enemy before the
smaller elephant could regain his feet. A moment
of mauling followed, in which thundering hoofs
knocked resistance from the fallen beast, and then,
using his head for a combination roller and battering
ram, the angered elephant scraped the body of
the beleaguered animal along the hard sandy
ground until the heavy flesh was torn from the
runt’s body in great patches, and the blood flowed
from fully a dozen wounds.</p>

<p>Animal men with bull-hooks strove futilely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
pull him away. He shook them off and began to
pound the prostrate Billy with flail-like blows of his
trunk, suddenly to halt and wheel, trembling, yet
defiant. Old Mom, with Charles Churchill, her
keeper, at her head, was swinging under the side
wall to restore order. But the time for that was
past.</p>

<p>Floto was in the position of a cornered criminal.
He had disobeyed every law of the mistress of
the herd, and now he defied her. He did not even
wait for Old Mom to approach him. Head lowered,
trunk tightly curled, he swung forward to the
attack, butted her out of the way and plunged
through the side wall, out into the sparsely peopled
circus lot, an outlaw at last.</p>

<p>Wagons tumbled out of his way as he crashed
into them. Ticket boxes turned to matchwood
when he caught them and crushed them with swift
stamping blows of his heavy forefeet. Ropes
parted like strings before his plowing progress. A
workman crossed his path; the elephant caught him
in his trunk and threw him thirty feet into an irrigation
ditch. Back to the menagerie he went, to
butt every elephant that faced him, to overturn
cages, to seize frightened, screaming ponies and
break their backs. Then they called for the rifles.</p>

<p>Only thirty-thirties were in the ticket wagon,
equipped with leaden bullets. But the animal men
felt that enough shots from them might suffice; at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
least they might be able to hold the maddened beast
at bay until a rushing automobile, already sent
townwards, could return with army rifles. Hurriedly
the guns were distributed and the magazines
filled. Then as fast as hands could work the levers
thirty shots were fired at the head of the outlaw,
every one striking its mark.</p>

<p>But the bullets did little more than pierce the
heavy flesh; some of them dropped to the ground
without even breaking the thick armor of hide that
covered the elephant’s skull.</p>

<p>He stood and took the shots, one after another,
hardly seeming to notice their impact. Then suddenly,
as though bewildered, as though seeking a
reason for it all, he whirled for a moment in aimless
circles, then headed straight for the empty big top.
The bullets had not entered the animal’s thick skull,
but something akin to a thought had. The stinging
of the speeding lead in some way seemed to convey
an idea to the brute that the humans who had commanded
him were now striving to force him to do
a certain thing, and in a hazy moment of obedience
he hurried to its execution as swiftly as possible, the
only thing he knew!</p>

<p>Into the center ring he rushed, to halt, a single
elephant in the middle of a deserted circus tent.
There, alone, <i>sans</i> the music, <i>sans</i> the crowds, <i>sans</i>
the brilliance and the brightness which usually accompanied
the performance, Floto the outlaw, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
blood streaming from thirty bullet holes, without
guidance, without even a cue, went through every
figure of his act, while at the connections the men of
the circus stood and watched, unable to cope with
him, unable to kill him, unable to conquer him;
watched while he waltzed about the ring, while he
knelt over an imaginary trainer, while he walked
on his hind hoofs; and while, with a sudden change
of thought, he crashed across the stages, tore down
a section of seats, and then, bursting through the
side wall, ran for the open country.</p>

<p>All that night they trailed him, a trail of broken
fences, of smashed chicken yards, of wide swaths
through growing crops! The next morning they
found Floto a bare half-mile from town, where
he evidently was circling back to the circus. But
he still was the outlaw, still the renegade. He
sighted the armed men and trumpeted. Then
with a swift movement he turned toward a telegraph
pole and wrapped his trunk about it. There
was a sharp crackle. Wires spit and sang as they
popped. Floto had snapped the pole clean at its
base and, swinging it even as an angered man would
swing a club, had headed straight toward his hunters!
There they killed him, with three swift volleys
of steel-jacketed bullets, even as he charged them,
Floto who had feared discipline enough to become
a renegade!</p>

<p>From all of which may be gathered that the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of the keeper of the bulls is far from a bored existence.</p>

<p>Nor is it always a matter of a spasmodic breakaway
or a single bad animal that must be feared.
There is one instance, a great many years ago, of a
herd that was incorrigible not only for a day, but a
season.</p>

<p>But to the story: There had been a change in
the men commanding the herd, a sudden change,
and one which the elephants did not like. At least,
they gave evidence of a displeasure that was not
only keen but lasting. The show, as was usual,
opened its season in the Coliseum, in Chicago, and
according to the ordinary custom held its rehearsals
for three days before the beginning of the regular
performance.</p>

<p>The day for dress rehearsal came—the final time
of practice, in which the whole show, from spectacle
to races, is run through—and twelve elephants of
the herd of twenty-two, each with its heavy velvet
blankets, its trappings and its howdah, were led
into position to await the signal for entrée. Which
was also the signal for trouble.</p>

<p>The acoustics of a building are far different from
those of a tent. The minute the band started, so
did the elephants. Some arrived at the arena by
the front entrance. Some shot down the chutes into
the basement, some headed straight for the horse
stalls, crippling a number of the ring stock, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
six became wedged in another chute, and for a time
threatened the safety of that portion of the building.
At last sweating, shouting bull-men corralled
them and prepared for the only possible thing,—to
rehearse their charges all night if necessary to make
them ready for the next afternoon’s show.</p>

<p>The program was followed; dawn found the elephants
still being forced through their entrance and
their tricks. But even after twelve hours of practice
only four of the big beasts were found sufficiently
tractable to risk in entrée.</p>

<p>Show time came, with the blankets again, the
trappings and the howdahs. The elephants made
their entrance. The audience applauded enthusiastically.
All of which was another new noise to
the nervous beasts. Off went the four, heading for
their picket line in the basement, and starting a
panic among the pachyderms that had been left behind.
Three hours later the tired elephant men
reported peace again, but only for a short time.
The night show brought another near-panic, and the
“preposterous poundage of ponderous pachyderms”
was eliminated from the program of the circus, at
least as far as the Coliseum was concerned. In
this connection, the circus man is no person to take
risks. His first thought is his audience, and when
animals show signs of incorrigibility, they are removed
from performance until they have become
good again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>In the two weeks of the show’s engagement which
followed, the trainers prepared for the future.
Every unusual noise, every possible thing that might
be the cause of fright on the part of the beasts, was
provided for. Horses dragging sacks were ridden
up and down in front of them; guns were fired behind
them, tin cans dropped in a pile in front of
them; they were even entertained every few hours
by a pair of fighting dogs! Whenever an animal
trainer thought of a noise or thing that might
frighten an elephant, the picket line immediately
was introduced to it, with trimmings.</p>

<p>On the last day of the engagement the trainers
reported that they believed they had made progress
sufficient to allow the presentation of one elephant
act. The presentation was all. The only action
was that of the entire herd rushing wildly for
that dearly beloved basement and its comparative
safety.</p>

<p>But now there came a new chance; the show left
the indoors and went into the open, back to the
land of canvas. For three months there was nothing
more dangerous than minor fretfulness and
lone recalcitrants, and it was believed that trouble
at last was over. Then, at Rawlins, Wyoming,
where the cow-puncher population of the entire surrounding
country had congregated to watch the unloading
of the big circus, the bulls were led forth
as usual—and a dog fight started!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>A rampage began less than a minute later. Five
minutes more and the railroad yards were filled
with wandering, frightened elephants; a passenger
train was stalled at the station, the engineer fearing
to pull out lest his coaches be overturned by an elephant
galumphing forth from a hiding place behind
a box car; the passenger station was filled with
refugees; and the cow-punchers were eagerly volunteering
to rope the darned critters an’ bring ’em
in, draggin’ behind a saddle pommel. More, when
six of the bulls took to the open prairie the offer
was accepted—anything that looked like aid was a
welcome thing to the circus just then—and the
strangest roping contest in Wyoming’s history began.
Also the greatest defeat that a bunch of
Western cow-punchers ever knew.</p>

<p>Not that they didn’t succeed in roping the big
beasts, for they did. But that was the end of the
capture. The minute a rope settled about an elephant’s
neck the pachyderm decided to go elsewhere,
taking rope, horse and cow-puncher with him
until the lariat snapped. As a last resort some
thirty of the cow hands decided upon a form of
elephant round-up, an attempt to force the elephants
to submission by the usual methods of a
cattle round-up. It lasted only until the six recalcitrants
decided to move on. Whereupon they lowered
their heads, pushed the horses and riders out
of the way and loped gayly forth to new fields and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
broader prairies. Late that night a new relay of
cow-punchers, accompanied by a half dozen of the
captured elephants which had been thoroughly pacified,
and headed by the bull-keepers, found the
truants a full twenty-five miles from town, and by
mingling them with the passive beasts finally returned
them to the cars. After which another full
three weeks passed in which the elephants were
missing from performance, followed by another
period of passivity.</p>

<p>This lasted, however, only until the show reached
Bakersfield, California, and a canvasman chased a
frightened rabbit, which had bobbed up about the
show grounds, under the side walling and into the
menagerie tent. The rabbit went out the other
side of the tent. So did twelve of the parade elephants,
wrecking everything from the menagerie to
the sideshow, and heading for an irrigation canal
at the other end of the lot. Here they were
dragged from the water, the parade paraphernalia
muddy and ruined, and brought back to the picket
line once more, where they remained peaceful for
a whole twenty-four hours. The next day, at
Santa Barbara, an agitator chirruped, the queer,
almost bird-like call which precedes a panic, and
away they all went again! Some chose town and
the wrecking of fences and small buildings. Others
made the outer circle, disrupting the garden hopes
of residents for weeks to come. Two more made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
for the fish market and ruined it. Another struck
an automobile, wrecking it and injuring two persons.
The remaining six of the runaways, smelling the
open water, made for the bay and hopelessly mired
themselves in the salt marshes, with the result that
forty horses and nearly three thousand feet of rope
were required to pull each of them from the
mud.</p>

<p>That was too much. A few days later, at Tucson,
Arizona, the bull cars were run fifteen miles
out of town, and the agitators were put to death.</p>

<p>All of which has its antithesis in another stampede
which actually made money. The gods sometimes
favor even a keeper of the bulls, and such was
the case in the stampede of Old Mom’s herd at
Idaho Falls.</p>

<p>The day had been hot. The elephants came out
of the performing ring of the matinée tired and
“juggy,” as a bull-man terms lassitude, to be led
quite indifferently to a near-by irrigation ditch to
drink. There, by their straining against the elephant
hooks, they indicated that a mere drink would
not satisfy.</p>

<p>“What’re we goin’ t’ do?” inquired an assistant
as he scrambled at the end of a bull-hook. “They
want in an’ they’re goin’ t’ have in!”</p>

<p>“Hold them bulls!” came the curt reply of the
keeper. “Sink that hook deeper an’ hold them
bulls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“What’s the matter?” It was a new voice.
“They just want a swim, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yeh.” The keeper touched his cap to the
owner of the show. “Yeh—that’s what they’re
after.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you let ’em have it?”</p>

<p>“Afraid. Snake River’s just over this hump
here, and they might make for it. It’s deep an’
swifter’n ’ell. Been a half a dozen horses drowned
right here; nothing’s ever come out of it alive.”</p>

<p>“But,” argued the little owner, “that isn’t this
ditch, is it? Why should they want to go over to a
river they can’t see when there’s all this water right
here?”</p>

<p>The keeper grinned in sickly fashion.</p>

<p>“You don’t know bulls. They’ll—”</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding. Let ’em go. The poor
things are hot.”</p>

<p>“All right.” The keeper sighed—a sigh with a
good-by in it. “You’re boss. Hey, men! Turn
’em loose!”</p>

<p>There was a rush, a splash of water, then shining
bulky forms that flopped and scrambled out of
the water at the other side of the irrigation ditch.
The herd, in its entirety, had smelled broader expanses
of water, and almost abreast they went for
it, all but Old Mom, who trumpeted wildly, who
squealed and bellowed and roared, but who for a
moment remained alone. Even her faithful Frieda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
deserted her, running wildly with Snyder and Trilby
over the edge of the hump and sliding down a declivity
of solid rock into the raging waters of the
Snake River rapids. Behind them the two remaining
members of the herd halted, stood a moment
in fear, then whimpering returned to the side of
Old Mom, while the circus owner, believing he had
sent a valuable elephant herd to its death, hurriedly
decided to move elsewhere than within the
range of the baleful eye of the keeper of the
bulls.</p>

<p>Down in the rapids, with its falls and dangerous
suck holes below, the three elephants floundered a
moment, then splashed out in different directions.
Frieda, her common sense aroused at last, swam
with all her strength straight for the opposite
shore, finally landing in safety just above the falls.
But Trilby and Snyder, forgetting the swiftness of
the current in their enjoyment of the water’s coolness,
drifted lazily along, until too late. A moment
more and the hundreds of excited sightseers
who had gathered atop the banks saw the rolling,
tossing, suddenly frantic beasts plunge, over the
falls and into the suck holes and whirlpools beneath,
from which no living thing ever had
emerged.</p>

<p>By this time the owner was far away and seeking
even more speed. A man in an automobile
hastened to overtake him and to break the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
that his elephants were in the Snake River death
trap. He nodded glumly and went on.</p>

<p>The elephants now were in a suck hole which
formed the main amusement of the boys of the
town who, when the lure of other games had faded,
were wont to push large logs over the edge into the
swirling waters and watch them churned to bits by
the fierce action of the boiling waters. Trilby had
vanished. Only the edge of Snyder’s trunk showed
at long intervals. Atop the bank the keeper of the
bulls breathed another good-by to two of his best
elephants.</p>

<p>Then a shout. Fully three hundred feet below
the suck hole Trilby, immersed for what had
seemed hours, had come to the surface and was
fighting valiantly toward shore. Finally she gained
it, to crawl to a rocky ledge, to stagger, then to fall
exhausted. Five minutes later Snyder lay beside
her, equally fatigued. And there they remained,
moaning with almost human intonations, until their
keeper, with Old Mom, came to their rescue.</p>

<p>All through the town the word spread that a
living thing—two living things, in fact—had survived
the death trap. The crowds gathered; it
was as though conquering heroes had returned from
a war. The townspeople even forgave Frieda and
refused damages when it was learned that she had
ambled from her landing point to a livery yard
and caused a panic among the horses stabled there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
That night the tents were unable to contain the
crowds that thronged to see the elephants which
had braved the whirlpools. And in the years to
come, the simple announcement of the coming of
the circus was enough to insure the influx of thousands
of dollars, as long as it contained the assurance
that the death-trap elephants would be a part
of the performance.</p>

<p>But such a happy thing as this in the life of a
bull-keeper is almost too good to be true. In the
circus world the young man seeking adventure is
never told to go West, nor to become a prospector,
nor to drive in motor-car speed events, nor to aspire
to the Northwest Mounties. It is merely suggested
that if he’s really in earnest and doesn’t care what
happens, it might be a good idea to learn the rudiments
of being a keeper of the bulls. After that if
he isn’t satisfied he’s hopeless!</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> COURTNEY RYLEY COOPER</p>

<p class="ph1">Illustrated. Crown 8vo. Cloth. 238 pages.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“To any one who has ever thrilled over a circus, ‘Under the
Big Top’ should be a joy. Mr. Cooper knows his subject. He
writes of the circus, its pageantry and its romance, its vicissitudes
and its thrills, in a vivid, most entertaining fashion.”—<i>“F. F. V.”
in The New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Cooper gives no end of interesting information about the
circus. He has the dramatic instinct that both senses a good
story and tells it well, and so his little anecdotes are always interesting,
having point, punch, humor, pathos, human appeal.”—<i>The
New York Times.</i></p>

<p>“There is so much genuine interest in Mr. Cooper’s book that
a detailed account of the subjects of which it treats is impossible.
His book is a compendium of information concerning a subject
on which there has always been a great amount of speculation
and curiosity, and it answers fully and completely every question
that can be asked about the circus.”—<i>The Philadelphia
Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>“Whenever the historian of the circus sits down to his task and
squares his elbows, he will need to have on his desk Mr. Cooper’s
‘Under the Big Top.’ As an account of the circus as it is, here
and now, it is altogether satisfying.”—<i>Brander Matthews in
The Literary Digest International Book Review.</i></p>

<p>“Taken all in all, ‘Under the Big Top’ is certainly one of the
most fascinating books of the season. It is that unusual type of
book that appeals to young or old, boys and girls, men and women.
It takes us to a strange world outside our own lives and tells us
about it interestingly and truly.”—<i>The Detroit Saturday Night.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
